Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles
Silver nitrate was selected as a precursor metal salt for preparation of nanoparticles. The AgNPs were made by the reaction of carrot extract and 10 mM aqueous solution of AgNO3 (Merck). Silver nitrate solution (10 mM) was mixed with the aqueous extract of carrot extract at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v) to a volume of 100 mL in a flask. Flasks were covered in aluminum foil to prevent photo-activity. Flasks were incubated for different durations i.e. 1–8 hrs duration at different pH of reaction mixture that is (3, 5, 7 and 9) to optimize synthesis of biogenic NPs. UV–vis spectrophotometer (Cecil, 7000 series) was used for initial confirmation of NPs synthesis. The centrifugation of the solution was carried out at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The resultant pellet was washed three times using distilled water after discarding the supernatant to discard any remaining contamination. The pellet was collected in a Petri plate and kept in drying oven between 60 °C and 70 °C until drying. Dried nanoparticles were scratched from Petri plate and grounded with pistol mortar and the resultant blackish fine powder was kept in falcon tubes at room temperature which was then used for further characterization and bioactivities.
