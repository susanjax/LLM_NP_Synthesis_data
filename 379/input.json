Preparation of Ricinus communis leaf extract
Fresh leaves of Ricinus communis were washed thoroughly with tap water followed by distilled water to remove all the dust and air dried. About 10 g of cleaned leaves were cut into small pieces, crushed using a mortar and pestle, and mixed with 100 mL of double-distilled water to obtain an aqueous extract. Another 10 g of leaves extract was mixed with methanol and incubated at 60–70 rpm overnight. The mixture was then filtered using Whatman's No. 1 filter paper and used for further study [15].
Synthesis of iron nanoparticles
A 0.1 M FeCl3·6H2O solution was prepared in double distilled water, and the aqueous leaf extract was mixed in a 1:1 ratio. The equal volume of leaf extract was added dropwise to the ferric chloride solution and stirred with a stirrer at room temperature. The appearance of a colour change in the solution from light yellow to black indicated the formation of iron nanoparticles. The obtained precipitate solution was centrifuged at 6000 rpm and washed with water, followed by drying in an oven at 60 °C [18].
Synthesis of silver nanoparticles
A 0.1 mM AgNO3 solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1698 g of AgNO3 in 1 L of double distilled water. For the fabrication of silver nanoparticles, 10 mL of plant extract was added to 90 mL of 1 mM AgNO3 in a 250 mL conical flask, and the mixture was kept in a dark place at room temperature for 48 h. The formation of silver ions to silver nanoparticles was marked by the appearance of a dark brown colour. The synthesized silver nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 20 min. The particles were then washed with water and 70% ethanol and dried at 60 °C before being stored for further study [19].
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was used to investigate the morphology of the synthesized iron and silver nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 7(a and b). The TEM micrographs showed that the green-synthesized iron nanoparticles were spherical and cuboid in shape, with a size range of 50 nm. These findings were consistent with previous studies. The TEM image of iron nanoparticles revealed that the nanoparticles were spherical in shape, with a size of ∼70–100 nm [34]. Prodan et al. [35] reported similar results from TEM pictures of iron nanoparticles, showing a spherical morphology with an average size of the nanoparticles being 7 ± 0.2 nm. The TEM image of silver nanoparticles showed morphology of spherical and round shapes with an average particle size of 50 nm. The present findings are similar to those of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles, which are spherical in shape with sizes ranging between 20 and 40 nm [32]. Silver nanoparticles synthesized using extracts from three medicinal plants, M. balbisiana, A. indica, and O. tenuiflorum, showed that spherical shapes were predominant, with sizes up to 200 nm [36]. Moreover, the TEM micrographs of green-synthesized silver nanoparticles using medicinal plant Lonicera japonica leaves extract have been reported, clearly showing the original spherical morphology of AgNPs [37].
