Pomegranate waste extract preparation (PWE)
Pomegranate waste was collected, washed with tap water, dried in the oven, and then powdered. A 50 g of pomegranate waste powder were homogenized in 300 mL of distilled water and then heated at 50 °C for 45 min to obtain pomegranate waste extract (PWE). The PWE was stored at 4 °C in the refrigerator (Alowaiesh et al., 2023). Scheme 1 show the expermental layout of biological activity of AgNPs and its applications.
Green preparation of silver nanoparticles
Silver nitrate (AgNO3) was acquired from Sigma Aldrich and employed as a precursor. 5 mL of fresh PWE was added to 50 mL silver nitrate (1 M) with constant stirring (150 rpm) for 20 min at 50 °C and pH 6.8. the reaction continued until a brown-colored solution was obtained due to the reduction of AgNPs. The nanoparticles were stored until further analysis and characterization.
When PWE extract is added to a solution of silver nitrate, the color changes from no color to brown, suggesting the fabrication of PPAgNPs. Fig. 1A demonstrates that the resulting PPAgNPs absorb UV at 430 nm, verifying the Ag transformation. The TEM image (Fig. 1B) of the produced PPAgNPs revealed spherical particles ranging from 15 to 55 nm. The zeta sizer image in Fig. 1C shows the exact size of PPAgNPs is 20 nm. At the same time, the net surface charge was negative of −25.98 mV detected by zeta potential (Fig. 1D); Eight bands were seen in the FTIR spectra of PWE, whereas eleven bands between 3500 and 500 cm−1 were visible in the spectrum of PPAgNPs (Fig. 1E). These bands imply that the structure of PPAgNPs contains active groups like phenolic and alcoholic OH, NH, and NH2. The OH and NH2 groups have a frequency of 3,419.39 cm−1, while the CH group has a frequency of 2,982.66 cm−1. Alkyne group is related to the band at 2094 cm−1, while alkanes, alkenes, and aromatic compounds are related to the bands at 1,650.09 cm−1 and 1,373 cm−1, respectively. Esters were present, as indicated by bands at 1150 cm−1, while halide compounds were indicated by bands at 617.39 cm−1.
