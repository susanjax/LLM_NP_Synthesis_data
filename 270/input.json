Preparation of aqueous extract
The collected leaves were dried under the sun for four days. Then the leaves were isolated from the ribs and heated by an electric heater. The leaves were ground using an automatic grinder machine to obtain fine powders. A tightly closed container was used to store the powders for further use. 15 g powder was dissolved with 200 mL distilled water in a 500 mL Meyer flask. The mixture was then boiled for 30 min, followed by natural cooling. Later, the mixture was filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The filtrated solution was stored at four Â°C for further use.

Preparation of silver nanoparticle
45 mL 0.01 M AgNO3 solution was prepared in a 200 mL beaker. Then 5 mL of the prepared extract solution was added to react with the AgNO3 without applying heat

. Slowly, the transparent yellow color turned into the dark brown color with the formation of precipitation, indicating the formation of NPs in the solution. After 24 h, the color became more intense and more precipitation was formed. 10 mL solution was isolated in a test tube for UV analysis. The solution was then dried to obtain fine powders. A comparison of the present method has been compared with the literature and shown in

SEM images were taken in different magnifications of the synthesized AgNPs to observe the size and shape shown in

 (a-d). The formation of the NPs was confirmed by the surface morphology in their agglomerated form. The synthesized nanoparticles were found to be circular. The outcomes match the research works available in the literature [

]. The synthesized NPs are very small in size. The formed nanoparticles are of varying sizes, such as 13.8 nm, 19.6 nm, 24.0 nm, 26.2 nm, 32.7 nm, 45 nm, etc. The obtained AgNPs have contained aggregation
