Preparation of AgNPs using xanthan gum
To synthesize Xanthan gum stabilized AgNPs, a test tube was filled with 5 mL of aqueous silver nitrate (0.5%) solution and 5 mL of aqueous xanthan gum (0.5%) solution. The reaction was performed at 150 °C for various time intervals, namely 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min, using a Monowave. Subsequently, the test tube was removed from the Monowave and used for further characterization and investigation without any additional treatment.

        X-ray diffraction analysis was performed to verify the phase and crystallinity of AgNPs. The results are shown in
Fig. 5
, which displays the diffraction signals at 2 theta values of 38.01°, 46.09°, 64.61°, and 77.17°. The most intense peak corresponds to the (1 1 1) plane. Deviations from ideal crystallinity, such as finite crystallite size and strain, lead to broadening of the diffraction lines. The broadening observed in these peaks is mainly attributed to the effect of AgNPs.

TEM analysis of XG stabilized AgNPs
The TEM image of XG stabilized AgNPs synthesized using green method is displayed in
Fig. 6
(a). The image indicates that the AgNPs are spherical and evenly dispersed within the XG polymer matrix. A histogram of the particle size distribution of AgNPs was created by counting approximately 85 particles, as depicted in
Fig. 6
(b). More than 70% of the particles were smaller than 10 nm, and only a few particles were observed above 15 nm. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of this sample, shown in
Fig. 7
, displays polycrystalline diffraction rings that can be indexed to cubic-phase and crystalline Ag, providing evidence for the identity of the phase and crystallinity of AgNPs.
