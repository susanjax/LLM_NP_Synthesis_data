Synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles.
ZnO NPs were synthesized by low temperature sol–gel method. Basically, 0.09 g Zn(CH3COOH)2 and 0.12 g KOH were dissolved into 50 ml methanol and mixed rapidly while stirring at 1,000 rpm at 60 °C for 5 min and then cooled to room temperature so as to obtain transparent solution of ZnO NPs. The resulting nanoparticles were then washed with triple-distilled water by using centrifugal method for several times to remove the organic impurities present in it. The ZnO NPs thus prepared were then annealed at 300 °C for the crystallinity improvement and used further for its structural, optical, and surface evaluation properties.

Characterization of ZnO nanoparticles
The XRD analysis (Fig. 1) clearly revealed the sharp and distinct peaks. These peaks were analyzed with JCPDS data file 05-0664 and confirmed the presence of pure crystalline ZnO. No peaks corresponding to zinc metal was detected indicating that the deposited ZnO NPs are highly pure in phase. The four peaks in XRD correspond to (100), (002), (101), and (103) reflections. The average grain size as calculated by using Scherer formula from first three peaks is ~15 nm.
Surface morphological study was carried out using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The synthesized ZnO NPs were dispersed in water with 50 % w/v and subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 3 h so as to remove the agglomeration if present in the dispersion. The resulting dispersion then spin-coated on to a cleaned glass slide for the scanning electron microscopy wherein, a uniform growth of ZnO spherical nanoparticles were obtained.
