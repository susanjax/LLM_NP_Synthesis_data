Synthesis
For the preparation of TM-ZnO samples, MnSO4·H2O, FeSO4·7H2O, Co(CH3COO)2·7H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and CuSO4·5H2O were applied as the precursor salts of Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ respectively and Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O as the source of zinc. 1.317 g (1 M) of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O were mixed with 3% molar ratio of the transition metal ions and dissolved in the reaction solution composed of 10 ml ethanol and 10 ml distilled water. During this process, the ultrasonic dispersion is used to ensure a more uniform dispersion of the solution. After that, 0.59 g NaOH were added and kept under stirring for 10 min. The mixture was put in a 30 ml autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 12 h. The autoclave was cooled down to room temperature. The products were separated by centrifugation and washed with distilled water and ethanol turn by turn. Pure ZnO samples were synthesized from zinc acetate under the same solvothermal conditions without using the dopant precursors.
Characterization
XRD measurement was carried out to confirm the phase and check transition metal doping in the ZnO crystal lattice. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the prepared samples, it can be seen that all the peaks belong to wurtzite structure of ZnO (JCPDS No. 36–1451), that is, transition metal ions are all doped in ZnO lattice. It is not detail the position of transition metal exactly, due to the amount of doping ions is very small and they have more possibility to replace zinc atom. The peaks between 30 and 40° refer to the crystal (100), (002), (101), relativity, before 50°, it refer to crystal (102), before 60, it refer to (110), before 70°, it refer to (200), (112), (201), relativity. However, the intensity of the (002) peak is enhanced for Cu–ZnO, compared to that of pure ZnO. This means that doped Cu2+ enhances the c-axis growth of ZnO crystals. XRD analysis demonstrates that transition metals doped ZnO are composed of hexagonal ZnO with good crystal quality.
The SEM measurement was carried out to investigate the morphology of the samples and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a1-3e1 show the SEM images of ZnO crystals doped with Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu respectively. After transition metal doping, the TM-ZnO crystals are nanoparticles. Compared to the pure ZnO, doping transition metal ions did not change their morphologies obviously. The size of the pure ZnO crystals is in the range of 200–400 nm (Fig. f1). However, after the introduction of transition metals, the average sizes are enlarged in the range of 200–500 nm. The reason may be that doping transition metal ions affect the crystalline nucleation and growth of ZnO. However, Cu–ZnO sample shows nanorod morphology as compare to pure ZnO. This is attributed to Cu atom which drastically affecte crystalline growth and promote the one dimensional growth. Furthermore, the EDS elemental maps show that the doping atoms are uniformly distribution in the TM-ZnO crystals. (Fig. a2-e2). Moreover, the EDS elemental map shows that Zn and O are evenly distributed on the whole crystals (f2).
