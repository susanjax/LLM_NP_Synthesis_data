Synthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs)
TiO2 NPs were synthesized using titanium (IV) isopropoxide [Ti (OCH (CH3)2)4], glacial acetic acid (CH3COOH) and deionized water, in the molar ratio of 1:10:500, using the simple sol-gel method. Glacial acetic acid was preferred as the solvent as it would promote a high surface area and reduce the size of the synthesized particles [24]. 0.025 M of titanium (IV) isopropoxide, dissolved in 1 M of glacial acetic acid and deionized water, was added dropwise on stirring. It was then ultrasonicated for 30 min in a water bath and again kept for stirring. After the reaction was completed, the white coloured precipitate was collected by washing; it was repeated several times with distilled water and dried overnight at 100 °C. Finally, the sample was fine powdered and calcined at 500 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace. Similarly, TiO2 NPs were prepared with different concentration of titanium isopropoxide (0.05 M and 0.1 M) by following the above mentioned procedure. The synthesized TiO2 samples under different molar concentrations were named as T1 (0.025 M), T2 (0.05 M) and T3 (0.1 M), respectively.
Characterization of TiO2 NPs
The X-ray diffraction pattern of the synthesized TiO2 NPs at three different molar concentrations of titanium precursor was shown in Fig. 2. The diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 25.55°, 38.127°, 47.947°, 54.54°, 55.28°, 63.05°, 69.72°, 70.24° and 75.407°, corresponding to Miller indices (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220) and (215), respectively were assigned to the pure anatase phase with a tetragonal crystal structure (JCPDS card no.21-1272).
FESEM micrographs of the TiO2 NPs synthesized at three different concentrations by the sol-gel method are shown in Fig. 4. FESEM images of the samples T1 and T2 showed that the particles were highly agglomerated with rocklike structures and the sample T3 exhibited the formation of spherically shaped nanostructures, which were arranged in a uniform manner with particle sizes around 60 nm.
