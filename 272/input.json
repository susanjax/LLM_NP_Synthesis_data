Preparation of CS-PAA nanoparticles
The preparation of PAA-coated CS nanoparticles was carried out in two steps. Firstly, CS-TPP nanoparticles were prepared by an ionic gelation method which based on the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged chitosan and the negatively charged TPP (Wu et al., 2017). 0.01 mg/ml of CS in aqueous acetic acid solution (1, w/v %) was prepared and left on magnetic stirrer for 24 h. Then, the pH of this solution was adjusted to 6.0 by using sodium hydroxide. The CS in the prepared solution was cross-linked with 1% TPP. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4° C for 1.5 h and suspended with PAA using an Ultrasonic processor for 5 min. In the second step, the PAA and CS-TPP were combined through electrostatic attraction. Ten mg/mL carbodiimide solution was added to the earlier prepared CS-PAA nanoparticles to cross-link the CS-TPP particles with the PAA and kept overnight on stirring mode to ensure the adhesion of PAA coating onto CS-TPP through the formation of an amide bond between the carboxyl group of PAA and the amino group of the chitosan surface. Finally, the pH was adjusted within the range of 4.2 to 6.5 and the solution was ultracentrifuged for another 1.5 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was then discarded and the CS-PAA nanoparticles were resuspended in sterile water using an ultrasonic processor.
The prepared suspension of the particles showed an MPS of 2.98 ± 0.57 µm using the particle size analyzer. However, data obtained from the SEM images showed that particles had a mean particle size of 222.119 ± 70 nm. The particles showed ZP values of + 42.35 ± 7.85 mV.

The SEM image of CS-PAA nanoparticles (

) reveals the presence of nearly spherical particles, uniformly distributed in the nano-range. The spherical shape of CS-PAA particles was also reported in the work of Wu et al., (
