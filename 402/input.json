Perak was the source of freshly gathered M. dubia leaves. The leaves underwent many purification processes to eradicate dust and fungus, followed by a week-long sun-drying period to eliminate moisture. The desiccated foliage was transformed into a fine powder using pulverization. Ten grams of dry powder were extracted using 100 ml of distilled water in a 250 ml conical flask. Subsequently, the powder was subjected to a 10-min heating process, followed by cooling and filtration to get a raw extract. The extract was then incubated at a temperature of 4 °C.
Modified microwave-assisted green synthesis of AgNPs
AgNPs of different sizes were synthesized using the microwave-assisted green method. A 1 × 10−3 M solution of AgNO3 was made by dissolving it in 90 ml of distilled water in a 250 ml conical flask. A volume of 10 ml of crude extract was introduced into the solution to serve as a reducing agent. In addition, several quantities of fish collagen (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 g) were mixed with the solution to enhance its stability. The solutions were labeled as AgNPs-2, AgNPs-3, AgNPs-4, and AgNPs-5. The solution was inserted into the 800-W microwave oven and heated for 3 min. Upon examination, it was seen that the solution experienced a chromatic metamorphosis, transitioning from a state of colourlessness to a hue of yellow-brown. They analyzed the production of silver nanoparticles by UV–visible spectroscopy. The silver nanoparticle solution was centrifuged for 10 min at a rotational speed of 14000 revolutions per minute (rpm). The supernatant was discarded, while the nanoparticle fraction was sterilized using distilled water. The method above was iterated thrice to eradicate undesirable biomaterials and impurities [3]. A solitary specimen was meticulously created using an identical methodology to juxtapose the ramifications of microwave-assisted and non-microwave techniques. For the preparation, 0.1 g of collagen and an equivalent amount of silver nitrate, referred to as AgNPs-1, were used.
Based on the picture of the scanning electron microscope (SEM), the synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) produced using the microwave-assisted green synthesis technique exhibited a uniform and spherical shape. Based on the comparison, it was determined that the materials synthesized using the microwave-assisted approach showed a higher rate of synthesis compared to the green synthesis method. Fig. 2 exhibits the scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures of AgNPs-1 to AgNPs-5.
The XRD pattern of AgNPs-1 exhibited distinct peaks at 37.47°, 46.29°, 64.53°, and 77.31°. The diminished intensity of the tiny peaks in the XRD graph may be attributed to bioorganic molecules on the surface of the silver nanoparticles [22]. Fig. 6 depicts a comparison between AgNPs-1 and AgNPs-2, showing peaks at 37.66°, 43.73°, 64.72°, and 77.69°. Several research studies have compared the microwave-assisted green technique with the green synthesis method for synthesizing silver nanoparticles, as described in literature reviews [23]. Nthunya et al. [24] described the production of AgNPs using an alkaline solution of apple extract. The size of the AgNPs obtained by green synthesis was 29 nm, but the AgNPs produced using a microwave-assisted green technique had a size of 22 nm. This suggests that the microwave-assisted green method generates AgNPs of reduced dimensions. The XRD analysis assessed the structure and size of AgNPs-3, AgNPs-4, and AgNPs-5. XRD study of AgNPs-3 revealed diffraction peaks corresponding to silver's face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. The large heights of AgNPs [25] were confirmed by the sharp peaks at 37.49, 42.62, 63.90, and 76.95.
TEM determined the morphology and the size of the particles of AgNPs-2, AgNPs-3, AgNPs-4, and AgNPs-5. A drop of the nanoparticles’ suspension was placed on the carbon-coated copper grid to allow the water to evaporate inside a vacuum dryer. This is done to prepare the grid for the TEM analysis of Ag-nanoparticles. Furthermore, the AgNPs-2, AgNPs-3, AgNPs-4, and AgNPs-5 undergo a scanning process using TEM Philips CM-300. The TEM image of the prepared AgNPs-2 is presented in Fig. 8. Based on the image, the nanoparticles of Ag were spherical, with maximum particles in a range of sizes and a mean diameter of 80–100 nm.
