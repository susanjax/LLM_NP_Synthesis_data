Extract preparation
The Phyllanthus niruri leaves were gathered from the Aligarh Muslim University's Botany Department in Aligarh, India. In the shade, plant leaves were dried. Fine powder from the dried plant leaves was prepared, and 10 gm of powder was stirred into 100 mL of filtered sterilized water. Subsequently, aqueous extract was filtered using 0.22 mm filter paper and Whatman No. 1 filter paper (Maidstone, UK) (Millipore). The heavy biomaterials were extracted in an aqueous state that could be stored at 4 °C for subsequent usage after centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 5 min (
Bose and Chatterjee, 2015
).
Synthesis of silver nanoparticles (PA-AgNPs)
In a nutshell, 10 mL of aqueous extract was combined with 100 mL of a 1 mM AgNO3 solution and maintained for 5–6 h at 50 °C until brown precipitate had formed. This coloured precipitate was centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm; the pellet was put on a glass plate and dried in an oven for 24–48 h at 45° Celsius. Once completely dry, the powder was pulverized using a mortar and pestle (

).

The XRD spectra of biosynthesized Silver NPs, showing distinctive peaks at 29.31, 32.29, 38.08, 44.13, 64.48 and 77.36 corresponding to Miller indices values (1 0 0), (1 1 0), (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) simulated with JCPDS No. 01–087-0719 are shown in
Fig. 2
C. The spectra suggested the NPs with some amorphous nature which evaluated due to stabilization and functionalization through the polyphenolic groups of plant extract. Using the Debye-Scherer formula which is D = 0.9λ/βCosθ; where D is crystalline size in nm, λ is wavelength, β is the intensity of half width of maximum intensity line, 18 nm was the observed average crystalline size which was further validated by TEM analysis.

The transmission electron microscope (TEM) was also used to characterize biogenic Pn-AgNPs, which revealed spherical-shaped NPs with ∼ 20 nm being the mean particle size (
Fig. 4
). Most of nanoparticles were evenly dispersed but few were observed to form small clumps plausibly due to improper capping or agglomeration. TEM micrograph shows some particles of different shape and size and these variations in nanoparticles produced using plant extracts have been reported previously [2, 39].
