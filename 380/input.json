Synthesis of NPs
A gold stock solution was created by dissolving HAuCl4. H2O (1 g) in 50 ml D.W. in dark conditions. AgNO3 (1 × 10−2 M) was created for the silver stock solution by dissolving 0.084 g in 50 D.W. For AuNPs, Teak extracts at a concentration of 4 % (w/v) were added at room temperature to the 0.05 ml HAuCl4.H2O solution, and the volume was completed to 10 ml with D.W. Therefore, the concentration of Au3+ was 2.9 × 10−4 M, and the reduction method of Au3+ to AuNPs was confirmed by a color change from yellow to green. For AgNPs, 0.5 ml of the Teak extracts was loaded to the 0.1 ml AgNO3 solution and the volume was completed to 10 ml with D.W. The concentration of Ag+ was 1 × 10−4 M, and the reduction of Ag+ to AgNPs was confirmed by a color change from yellow to dark brown within 24 h.
TEM figures confirmed the formation and size of the NPs (Fig. 5). For AuNPs, we observed homogeneous size distribution with spherical morphologies and not in agglomerated form. The size of AuNPs was in a range of 10–22 nm (Fig. 5a). TEM shows that AgNPs were spherical with small grains and some dispersed NPs. The AgNP size was between 10 and 30 nm (Fig. 5b). The reduction in the NP size with increasing pH was also detected under TEM for AuNPs and AgNPs at pH 4.5 and 9 (Fig. 5c and d). At pH 10, spherical NPs with sizes less than 20 nm are distinguished (Fig. 5d). The alkaline environment increased the stabilizing and reduction activity of the anti-oxidants in Teak leaf extract [31].
The synthesized NPs were analyzed utilizing XRD measurements. Fig. 6a shows characteristic peaks at 2θ = 38.29°, 44.43°, and 64.68°, corresponding to (111), (200), and (220) of Au, respectively, indicating that the sample is composed of crystalline gold. The AgNPs pattern was confirmed by detecting 4 unique peaks in XRD (Fig. 6b) at 2θ = 37.85°, 44.0°, 64.2° and 77.2°, corresponding to (111), (200), (220), and (311), respectively, indicating the presence of a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure of metallic silver. Peaks detected in the XRD pattern are similar to those previously reported by Refs. [16,26,30,38]. The XRD results confirmed the crystallization on the surface of the AgNPs by the bio-organic phase.
