Folic acid-bovine serum albumin-gold nanoclusters synthesis (FA-AuNCs)
Synthesis of blue-emitting (λ = 450 nm) small gold nanoclusters was done based on previously published studies.13 Briefly, folic acid was prepared as 5% (m/v) stock solution in sodium carbonate buffer (20 mM, pH 8.5). Folic acid stock solution was added into BSA solution (5 mg/mL) with a molar ratio 800:1 (FA: BSA). NHS and EDC were added to achieve high efficiency of amidation with a molar ratio of 1:1.5:20 (FA: NHS: EDC). Folic acid was attached onto BSA through amidation with amino-groups on BSA (FA-BSA). Subsequently, 5 mL of FA-BSA was added to 5 mL aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (10 mM) under vigorous stirring at 37 °C. Fifty microliters of ascorbic acid (0.35 mg/mL) was added dropwise to trigger the formation of gold nanoclusters (FA-AuNCs). Then the solution pH was adjusted at 9 with NaOH.
Characterization of FA-AuNCs
FA-AuNCs exhibit a continuous absorption band without any obvious peak in the UV–Vis absorption spectrum (Figure 2, A). The DLS analyses exhibit 5.5 ± 0.4 nm hydrodynamic size and 0.005 polydispersity index for FA-AuNCs (Figure 2, B). Figure 2, C illustrates the FT-IR spectrum of BSA, FA, and FA-AuNCs. The characteristic amide I band of BSA is apparent at 1683 cm−1 as was predictable for a protein with a high proportion of α-helix. The band appearing at 1587.00 cm−1 can be attributed to strong primary amine scissoring, whereas the band centered at 3456.98 cm−1 can be attributed to primary amines. The 2940.79 cm−1 band corresponds to C–H vibration and the broad band at 720.65 cm−1 can be attributed to −NH2 and −NH wagging. In FA-AuNCs spectrum, C–H stretching at 2943.00 cm−1 and aromatic ring stretch of the pyridine and p-amino benzoic acid moieties in the range of 1300-1700 cm−1 which are characteristic vibrational modes associated with FA can be obviously seen. The line broadening appearing over 1700-1300 cm−1 is revealing the covalent linkage of FA with BSA.19 Fluorescence spectrum (Figure 2, D) shows a maximum emission at 450 nm with 360 nm excitation wavelength. The photograph of the FA-AuNCs suspension under the ultraviolet lamps is illustrated in Figure 2, E.
