Preparation of Titanium nanostructures
For the preparation of aqueous leaf extract (ALE) solution of M. oleifera, 10 g of M. oleifera powder dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water, boiled at 60 °C for 10 min to kill the pathogens in ALE solution. After cooling, ALE solution was filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles were synthesized by adding 10 ml of filtered ALE solution to 90 ml of 5 mM Titanium dioxide solution (pH 1.5) in an Erlenmeyer flask under stirring at 50 °C. After 5 h, the developed dark brown colour confirmed the formation of Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiNPs) [3]. Finally, well-formed Titanium dioxide nanoparticles were acquired by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min and thus separated Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiNPs) were dried and used for further analytical techniques.
Characterization of Titanium nanoparticles
Titanium nanoparticles were characterized using UV–Vis spectroscopy to find the structural properties of TiNPs as depicted in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the spectra was recorded as a function of reaction time (5 h) of TiNPs. From this analysis it is observed that the maximum absorbance of TiNPs was attained at 428 nm as evident from absorbance spectrum and this peak was assigned due to the presence of surface plasmons.
SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) analysis was carried out to understand the topology and the size of the TiNPs, which showed the formation of higher density polydispersed spherical TiNPs of various sizes. The SEM image showing the high density Titanium nanoparticles synthesized by the leaf extract further confirmed the development of titanium nanostructures. Most of the nanoparticles were scattered, as observed under SEM (Fig. 3). The SEM analysis showed the spherical Titanium nanoparticles of particle size around 100 nm as well.
