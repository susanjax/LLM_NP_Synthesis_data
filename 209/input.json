Synthesis of ZnO nanosheets
A facile solvothermal method was attained for the synthesis of ZnO nanosheets. Initially, 6 mmol of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in a 60 mL solution of 1:1 DI water and ethylene glycol. The solution was stirred for 30 min followed by the addition of urea in a molar ratio of 4:1 with respect to zinc precursor. After stirring for another 30 min the reaction mixture was put in a Teflon-lined autoclave and placed in a hot air oven at 100 ℃ for 12 h to complete the reaction. After that, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature naturally and precipitates were centrifuged followed by washing and drying at 70 ℃ overnight. The obtained material was further treated with an AgNO3 solution for functionalization
Synthesis of Ag-Doped ZnO
ZnO nanosheet powder was dispersed in absolute ethanol using magnetic stirring. Then, 10 mg of PVP and 12 mg of AgNO3 were added to the dispersion followed by continuous stirring. After that, 15 mL of sodium borohydride solution in DI was added dropwise and stirred for another hour. On completion of the reaction, the solution was centrifuged to collect the precipitates, which were then collected through washing and drying.
All the indexed peaks are matched with the standard data JCPDS No. 01–079-2205 which confirms the hexagonal wurtzite structure of zinc oxide. The crystallite size (D) of the ordered domains was evaluated by utilizing the Debye-Scherrer relation as represented below:

where θ is the diffraction angle, β is full width at half maxima (FWHM) of the peak, k is the shape factor and λ is the wavelength of incident x-rays, which is 1.5406 Å. The average crystallite size was found to be ∼ 34 nm. Hence, the crystalline ZnO nanosheet structures were successfully synthesized. A similar kind of XRD spectra was obtained from a study by Xu et al., where they synthesized Ag/ZnO nanosheet via the hydrothermal method

3.2. Scanning electron microscopy
Field emission scanning electron microscopy was performed to investigate the morphology and size of prepared ZnO powder and doped Ag nanoparticles. ZnO material possesses nanosheet-like morphology having a sheet thickness in the range of 30–40 nm and a size of a few microns as can be observed in
