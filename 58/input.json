Green synthesis of rutile TiO2 NPs using Euphorbia heteradena Jaub root extract
0.5 G of TiO(OH)2 was added to the 15 mL aqueous extract of the root of E. heteradena Jaub with constant stirring at 60 °C for 2 h. After 3 min the color of the solution changed to light gray due to the excitation of surface plasmon resonance which indicates the formation of nanoparticles. Bioreduction process was monitored by UV–vis and FT-IR spectra of the solution. Then the mixture of NPs was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 30 min to completely precipitation of TiO2 NPs. The obtained precipitate was then washed three times with chloroform and ethanol, respectively, then air dried for 24 h at room temperature.
Characterization of TiO2 NPs 
The crystallinity of the TiO2 NPs was confirmed via XRD analysis. XRD analysis (Fig. 4) showed intense peaks corresponding to (110), (101), (111) and (210) Bragg׳s reflection based on the crystallinity of rutile TiO2 NPs (JCPDS no. 99-101-0954). The main peak of 2θ=27.4° matches the (110) crystallographic plane of rutile form of TiO2 nanoparticles, indicating that the nanoparticles structure produced is only rutile form and not of anatase or brookite form. The broadening of the peaks clearly shows the small size of the nanoparticles.
Morphology and size of the as-synthesized rutile TiO2 NPs was investigated using TEM. In Fig. 4, the TEM micrograph of the green synthesized rutile TiO2 NPs indicates the nanoparticles are spherical in shape with a narrow size. The particle size distribution is shown in Fig. 4.
