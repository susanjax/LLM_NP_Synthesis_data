Synthesis of L-Cys capped AgNPs
L-Cys capped AgNPs were synthesized according to our previously reported method [16]. In a typical run, 3 mL AgNO3 (0.05 M) was added to 20 mL of L-Cys solution (0.005 M) in a molar ratio of 1.5:1. The mixture was irradiated under a high-pressure mercury lamp when blending was finished. After the reaction had proceeded for about 2.5 h, the solution changed to a yellow color. Besides, the different molar ratio of AgNO3 to L-Cys ranging from 1:1, 1.5:1 to 1:1.5 and the UV illumination time from 30 min to 180 min were also investigated by UV–vis analysis.
characterization of L-Cys capped AgNPs
The phase purity and crystallinity of the AgNPs is supported by XRD analysis, and the result is shown in Fig. 1d, four characteristic peaks at 2θ values of 38.2°, 44.4°, 64.5° and 77.5° were observed, related to Bragg reflections planes (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1), respectively. Although the diffraction intensity of the silver was a little low and the crystallization was poor, the absence of silver oxide peaks indicates that the as-prepared nanoparticles are pure silver and the presence of L-Cys as a capping agent on the surface of the AgNPs did not lead to any AgNP phase change. Moreover, all of the peaks can be assigned to the face centered cubic (fcc) phase of Ag (JCPDS 04-0783) [26]. The morphology and size of the as-synthesized AgNPs were characterized using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The TEM image (Fig. 2a) showed that the L-Cys capped AgNPs were monodispersed and exhibited a spherical-like morphology with the average diameter of 10 nm, revealing the successful formation of AgNPs. Meanwhile, crystal lattice of the AgNPs is also clearly apparent in HRTEM image. Obvious lattice fringes with a interplanar d-spacing of 2.4 Å were observed from the HR-TEM image (Fig. 2b), which matches the spacing between (1 1 1) planes of silver (JCPDS No. 04-0783), indicating that the most as-synthesized L-Cys capped AgNPs might grow preferentially on the (1 1 1) plane [24]. In addition, by means of energy dispersion microanalysis (EDX) it can also confirms the successful formation of AgNPs. As displayed in Fig. 2c, the spectrum showed a signal between 3 and 4 keV originated from elemental silver, which is a typical range for the optical absorption band of silver nanocrystallites as a result of the SPR of AgNPs [26]. The other signals of C, O and S that may have originated from L-Cys bound onto the AgNPs surfaces, and the appearance of the Cu signal was from the copper grid that was used to prepare the sample.
