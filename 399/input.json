Fabrication of curcumin-capped silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) Curcumin capped silver nanoparticles have been prepared via the chemical reduction method of silver ions (Ag+) via phenolic groups present in Curcuma longa extract, as reported previously38–41 with slight modifications. Typically, 25 ml of 0.2 M of ethanolic solution of AgNO3 was added to 75 ml of curcumin ethanolic extract under vigorous stirring and reflux at 60 °C. Then, 10 g of PVP 40 000 was added to the reaction vessel under vigorous stirring and reflux. The reaction temperature was kept at 60 °C for 6 h. The reaction colour changed from orange to brownish-yellow, indicating the formation of silver nanoparticles capped with curcumin.
Fabrication of curcumin-capped zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) Curcumin-capped zinc oxide nanoparticles have been prepared via the chemical reduction method of zinc precursors (Zn2+) via phenolic groups present in Curcuma longa extract, as reported previously42–44 with minor modifications. Typically, 25 ml of 4 mM of ethanolic solution of Zn(CH3COO)2 was added to 75 ml of curcumin ethanolic extract under vigorous stirring and reflux at 70 °C for 2 h. The reaction colour changed from orange to yellowish precipitate, indicating the formation of Zn(OH)2 powder. Then, the collected precipitate was washed several times with distilled water, then dried at 100 °C, followed by calcination at 300 °C for three hours to obtain a yellowish powder of ZnO NPs.
The morphological properties, including the size and shape of each as-prepared curcumin capped-silver (Cur-AgNPs) and zinc oxide (Cur-ZnO NPs) nanoparticles, are shown in Fig. 3. TEM images showed that spherical shape is dominant for Cur-AgNPs and Cur-ZnO NPs. The average particle size presented in TEM images was around 20 ± 5 nm for Cur-ZnO NPs, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. Whereas the average particle size in the case of Cur-AgNPs was about 15 ± 5 nm, as depicted in Fig. 3c and d. According to TEM images of Cur-Ag NPs and Cur-ZnO NPs nanoparticles, the coating based on curcumin cannot be noticed due to the low contrast between Ag NPs and ZnO NPs. However, the presence of curcumin-based coating could be noticed via the tendency of agglomeration for Ag NPs and ZnO NPs, as shown in Fig. 3.
Moreover, the crystallographic structure of as-prepared biosynthesized Cur-AgNPs, and Cur-ZnO NPs have been investigated via XRD measurements, as depicted in Fig. 5. Cur-AgNPs exhibits five distinct features at 2θ = 38.27, 44.47, 64.71, 77.73 and 81.9°, respectively (see Fig. 5, Blackline), which can be assigned to the strongest line reflections from (1,1,1), (2,0,0), (2,2,0), (3,1,1), and (2,2,2) crystallographic planes of the face-centred cubic (fcc) of silver (Ag, Fm[3 with combining macron]m (225), see Fig. 5, Blackline). While in the case of Cur-ZnO NPs, the hexagonal structure was the predominant crystallographic structure. The typical XRD pattern for hexagonal structure shows three strongest lines at 2θ of 31.76°, 34.58°, and 36.67° due to the reflection of (100), (002), and (101) crystallographic planes. In addition, another five distinct patterns were represented at 47.89, 57.01, 63.29, 66.67, 68.25, 69.35 and 77.26° that corresponding to (102), (110), (103), (200), (112), (201) and (004) reflection plans.
