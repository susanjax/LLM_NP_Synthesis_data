Plant extract preparation and OL-Au NAPs synthesis
Fresh Olea europaea leaves were washed in distilled water (DI) to remove contaminants, phytoplankton, and bugs, then dried (25–30 °C) in the shade. Using a commercial grinder (TSK-949, West point, France), the dried leaves were ground into powder. For future usage, the powdered plant leaves were preserved in glass bottles. The extraction of the plant and the synthesis of OL-Au NAPs were carried out according to the process described by (
Khan et al., 2020a
). To 100 mL of DI water, ten grams of powdered Olea europaea leaves were added. The aqueous mixture was then brought to a boil for 5 min while being vigorously stirred. The filter paper was used to filter the boiling mixture to get a yellowish-colored extract. The extract of the leaves was then utilized as a reducing and capping agent in order to convert gold salt to its metallic form. To 25 mL of Olea europaea leaf extract, one mM HAuCl4·3H2O was added. Following that, the mixture was then heated to 80 °C for 65 min while constantly stirring to acquire a ruby red dispersion of OL-Au NAPs. After 15 min at 15,000 rpm centrifugation, the resulting OL-Au NAPs were rinsed three times with DI water and then dried in a 70 °C oven.

XRD was used to investigate the crystallinity and impurities of the green synthesized OL-Au NAPs. The intensity of the peak shows that the gold NAPs that were made are very crystalline. Also, the positions of the XRD peaks are very equivalent to those of metallic gold, and no peaks for impurities have been found (

A). Krishnamurthy et al. earlier reported a similar XRD peak pattern for gold NAPs produced from yucca (
Krishnamurthy et al., 2014
). TEM was used to examine the morphology of the green synthesized OL-Au NAPs. TEM scans revealed that OL-Au NAPs had a spherical shape with a homogeneous dispersion and no aggregation (

B). According to TEM measurements, the average particle size of synthesized OL-Au NAPs was 10.4 nm (
Fig. 2
C). EDX was used to conduct further elemental and compositional analyses. The sample consists mostly of gold, as shown by the EDX spectrum (
Fig. 2
D). Additional peaks of C and O in the EDX spectra may be attributable to the existence of phytomolecules on the surface of the produced OL-Au NAPs. Kumar et al. showed comparable EDX patterns for gold nanoparticles produced with Sansevieria roxburghiana leaf extract (
Kumar et al., 2019
).
