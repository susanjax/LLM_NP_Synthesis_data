Synthesis of ZnO and A-ZnO-NHs nanohybrids
The synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles was conducted through a tailored sol–gel approach, where 5 g of zinc nitrate along with Triton-X 100 were dissolved in 100 ml of distilled water. Here, the non-ionic surfactant Triton-X 100 played a crucial role in modulating the hydrolysis pace of the zinc salt while the solution underwent continuous stirring. This solution was stirred consistently for several hours. Following this, an ammonia solution was introduced gradually under constant stirring, leading to the formation of a turbid white zinc hydroxide sol. This sol was then left undisturbed for 40 h to undergo the sol-to-gel transition. The resulting gel was subsequently dried at 80 °C overnight and then calcined in an airflow environment at 400 °C for 2 h.
The synthesized ZnO nanoparticles were dispersed in distilled water under continuous agitation, followed by the addition of a silver nitrate solution, extending the stirring period for an additional 30 min. Subsequently, orange peel extract was incrementally introduced into the mixture with vigorous stirring for 2 h. Afterward, the precipitate was isolated and subjected to multiple washes using water, ethanol, and acetone, then dried at 80 °C overnight. Various molar ratios of silver were explored, and the samples were designated accordingly: 1 %, 3 %, and 5 % molar ratios of silver were labeled as A-ZnO-NHs-1, A-ZnO-NHs-3, and A-ZnO-NHs-5, respectively, while the ZnO nanoparticles were referred to as P-ZnO in the manuscript (

In
Fig. 2
, the XRD spectra of ZnO and its nanohybrid forms A-ZnO-NHs-1, A-ZnO-NHs-3, and A-ZnO-NHs-5 are presented, revealing distinct and intense peaks that highlight the high crystalline quality of both the pure ZnO and its nanohybrid. The diffraction patterns of pure ZnO show peaks at specific angles − 31.8, 34.4, 36.3, 47.6, 56.6, 62.9, and 68.0 degrees, corresponding to the (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), and (1 1 2) planes, respectively. This structure is consistent in the A-ZnO-NHs, confirming their hexagonal wurtzite configuration as well matched with the JCPDS-36–1451 standard, with lattice constants a and b at 3.250 Å and c at 5.207 Å, showing a (1 0 1) preferential orientation

. The identification of additional peaks at 38.23, 44.30, and 64.50 degrees within the A-ZnO-NHs spectra, corresponding to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) planes of cubic Ag, shows the presence of metallic Ag in the A-ZnO-NHs-1, A-ZnO-NHs-3, and A-ZnO-NHs-5 nanohybrids. As the amount of silver increases, the intensity of its peaks also increases, indicating more silver is deposited over the ZnO nanostructure. This suggests that adding up to 5 % silver does not affect the basic structure of zinc oxide.
Detailed examination of the A-ZnO-NHs-3 nanohybrids was conducted utilizing both scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to clarify their microstructural features and external morphology at varied levels of magnification (
Fig. 3
). These investigations revealed that the nanohybrids display a spherical or near-spherical shape, with their sizes predominantly falling within the 10–20 nm diameter range. This uniformity in shape and size suggests a controlled synthesis process that yields consistent particle dimensions. The EDS analysis revealed that the A-ZnO-NHs nanohybrids contain zinc, oxygen, and silver (
Figure S1
). It showed that the amount of silver varied in the different samples: A-ZnO-NHs-1 had 1.04 % silver, A-ZnO-NHs-3 had 1.59 % silver, and A-ZnO-NHs-5 had 2.08 % silver. Additionally, elemental mapping was conducted on the optimized A-ZnO-NHs nanohybrids, illustrating how silver, zinc, and oxygen are distributed within these materials (
Figure S2
). Further in-depth TEM analysis provided a more granular view of the A-ZnO-NHs-3 nanohybrids, affirming the size range observed in SEM imaging. Additionally, TEM imaging offered insights into the surface and composition of the nanohybrids, where smaller silver nanoparticles, approximately 5–10 nm in diameter, were distinctly visible. These silver nanoparticles appeared to be strategically deposited on the ZnO nanoparticles, indicating a synergistic assembly that could enhance the functional properties of the nanohybrids. The coherence between the observed SEM and TEM morphologies with the crystalline characteristics identified in XRD analyses lends strong support to the successful deposition of metallic silver over the ZnO nanostructure. This deposition is not just physical; it shows a chemical interaction between the silver nanoparticles and the ZnO base. This interaction likely contributes to the unique properties and potential applications of the A-ZnO-NHs-3 nanohybrids. This alignment of microscopic structural insights with crystallographic data underscores the intricate relationship between the nanohybrids' morphology, their crystalline structure, and their potential functional capabilities.
