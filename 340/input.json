Method of green synthesis ZnO nanoparticles
Prepare decoction of Moringa oleifera leaves powder with distilled water at 1:20 ratio under continuous stirring at 80–90 °C for 6 h. Filter the above mixture using Whatman filter paper-1 to get separated solid leaf pieces from the Moringa oleifera leaves extract. Add 0.272 mol of zinc acetate dihydrate (final concentration in mixture to be 0.0597 g/mL) to the filtered plant extract with continuously stirring for 2–3 h at 80–90 °C until precipitation is observed. Set the solution aside for 18 h in room temperature in order to facilitate the reaction completion and formation of ZnO nanoparticles. A dark green mixture having a pH of 7.45 and settled precipitates is observed. Centrifuge the solution at 3000 rpm to collect GsZnO-Nps and dry at 50 °C to make it powder for further evaluation Fig. 1. The possible mechanism of green synthesis of nano ZnO formation, using herbal extract is described as,

The crystalline structure of GsZnO-Nps was analyzed by an X-ray diffractometer. The diffractogram confirms the hexagonal wurtzite structure of GsZnO-Nps (Lei et al., 2012). The diffraction peaks were found at 2θ values of 31.53°, 34.19°, 36.02°, 47.31°, 56.37°, 62.63°, 66.16°, 67.72°, and 68.86°. These peaks are in line with JCPDS standard card 36–1451 of ZnO shown in Fig. 4 (A, B and C) which is in line with previously published literatures [4, 5 and 17]. The average crystallites size of GsZnO-Nps is 13.82 nm (Table 1) which is significantly lower than AR Grade ZnO is 30.87 nm and other previous reported literature (Jayachandran et al., 2021). Debye-Scherrer equation was used for evaluation of crystallite size,
The surface morphology of the GsZnO-Nps was examined by using a scanning electron microscope having x50k and x100 k magnification. Fig. 5 (A, B, and C) shows monodispersed spherical particles of GsZnO-Nps having approximately 50 nm particle size as deduced from the cited scale. Fig. 5 (D) shows the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis which reveals the quantitative elemental composition of GsZnO-Nps. The elemental analysis of green synthesis nanoparticles shows a mass % of Zn-77.07 and O- 22.93.
