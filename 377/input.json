Preparation of Aloe vera leaf extract
8 g of Aloe vera leaves were thoroughly cleaned with double distilled water and carefully cut into small pieces to make the ALE. The chopped leaves were heated at 37°C with constant stirring for 20 min in sterile double distilled water and then left to cool down. The ALE was filtered by Whatman filter No. 40 and the filtrate was stored at 4°C for further use.
Biogenic synthesis of AgNPs
For the preparation of AgNPs, 0.3 M AgNO3 precursor solution was prepared in sterile double distilled water. Previously prepared ALE was added to the precursor solution and vigorously stirred at room temperature. After 20 min, the color of the solution was changed from pale yellow to grey which indicated the formation of AgNPs. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min [32,33]. The obtained pellet was dried at 37°C for 48 h and used for further characterization and applications.
XRD analysis
The XRD analysis was performed to find the crystalline nature of biogenic AgNPs. The AgNPs were further demonstrated and confirmed by the characteristic peaks observed in the XRD spectrum of AgNPs. The four distinct sharp diffraction peaks of the 2θ values at 32°, 46°, 67°, and 77°was assigned to the plane of (111), (200), (220), and (311) respectively, indicates that the AgNPs are crystalline in nature with the JCPDS file no. 04-0783 as shown in Fig. 1 (b) [39].
