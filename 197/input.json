Synthesis and purification of ZnONPs
The fresh green leaves of C. igneus were collected from Courtallum, Tamil Nadu, India. The leaves were air-dried at room temperature and made into a fine powder. One gram of dried powder was mixed with 20 ml of deionized water. To this, 50 mM of zinc acetate (Himedia Laboratory, India) was added. The prepared mixture was kept at 120 °C for 20 mins. The prepared mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 mins and the supernatant was discarded. After that, the samples were washed and resuspended in deionized water. The washing step was repeated at least three times at room temperature and sonicated for 1 min.

Characterization 
In the present study, ZnONPs were found in a spherical shape, which was similar to a recent study 
[27]
. The homogeneous distribution of Zn (Red color indicates) and O (Green color indicates) matrix was confirmed quantitatively by small area elemental composition analysis of the synthesized ZnONPs. The EDX spectrum further confirmed the presence of Zn and O in the sample (

).
