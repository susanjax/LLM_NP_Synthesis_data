Synthesis of Ag-MgO NPs
Trichoderma aureoviride SKCGW013 (MG940965) was used for the synthesis of Ag-MgO NPs according to the methods described earlier with slight modifications 
[27]
. Briefly, the actively growing fungi strain was inoculated in 100 mL of PDB and cultured at 28 ± 2 °C for 4 days. Then the mycelium was collected by filtration using the Whatman No.1. filter paper and removed the excessive media by washing it with sterile water. Then, mycelium (30 g) was dissolved in sterile water and subjected to ultra-sonication for 5 min then kept in a shaking incubator at the agitation of 180 rpm and 28 ± 2 °C for overnight. Then, again filtered with Whatman No. 1 filter paper. Then, this extract was marked as Trichoderma extract (TE) and used for Agsingle bondMgO NPs synthesis. For the synthesis, 50 mg of TE, 5 mM of AgNO3, and Mg (NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water and kept in the dark condition at 40 °C for 24 h. The synthesized nanoparticles were collected and characterized according to the methods described in our earlier work

Preparation of nanocomposite
The Aloe vera extracts were prepared according to the methods described in our earlier work 
[29]
. The inner material of Aloe vera gum was collected by removing the outer layer and gently pealing. The Aloe vera inner gum was blended by homogenization then the obtained homogenous solution was filtered through muslin cloth followed by filter paper (Whatman No. 1) and freeze-dried. For the preparation of xanthan gum (XG), Aloe vera extract (AVE), Ag/MgO nanocomposite (XG-AVE-Ag/MgO NCs). 100 mg of XG was dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water by stirring overnight at room temperature. The equal volume of Ag/Mg NPs (10 mg/mL), AVE (2 mg/mL), and XG (2 mg/mL) were mixed by sonication for 15 min. Afterward, the NCs were kept at 60 °C for 24 h. Then, the XG-AVE-Ag/MgO NCs were collected by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 20 min. The pellet of XG-AVE-Ag/MgO NCs was freeze-dried and used for characterization and biological studies. 

Characterization 
The crystalline structure of the bimetallic nanoparticles and nanocomposite were studied by the XRD analysis (
Fig. 1
B). The results revealed the presence of two theta values at 28.27 (Mg; 220), 31.02 (Mg; 111), 38.17 (Ag; 111), 44.37 (Ag; 200), 46.126 (Ag; 202), 56.77 (Mg; 221), 64.46 (Ag; 220), 66.78 (Mg; 222) and 77.076 (Ag; 311) from the XRD spectrum of Ag/MgO NPs. The Ag/MgO NPs exhibited the Ag or MgO NPs corresponding to face-centered cubic and crystalline respectively which were in agreement with an earlier report 
[46]
. The two theta values were observed at 28.92 (Mg; 220), 32.28 (Mg; 111), 38.12 (Ag; 111), 44.18 (Ag; 200), 46.27 (Ag), 57.12 (Mg; 221), 64.36 (Ag; 220), 64.51 (Mg; 220) and 77.43 (Ag; 311) in XG-AVE-Ag/MgO NCs. The XRD planes observed evidenced the presence of both Ag+ and Mg+ in bimetallic and nanocomposites. The XRD data were compared with the earlier report on the XRD pattern of Ag NPs and MgO NPs

. In addition, the XRD peak changes observed in XG-AVE-Ag/MgO NCs around two theta values at 20° indicated the presence of polymers encapsulation, similarly, the XRD peak at around 20 °C for XG and AVE 
[50]
, 
[51]
. Moreover, some unidentified peaks around 10° to 25° observed in the Ag/MgO NPs might be related to the capping of the TE on Ag/MgO NPs.

The morphological characteristics of both nanomaterials were evaluated by FE-TEM analysis. The Ag/MgO NPs were poly-dispersed and spherical shaped, and their size ranged from 14.00 to 136.13 nm with an average size of 37.83 ± 2.45 nm (
Fig. 3
A, B). The EDS mapping results evidenced the presence of Ag, Mg, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen in Ag/MgO NPs (
Fig. 3
C–I). In the case of nanocomposite (XG-AVE-Ag/MgO NCs) were exhibited the spherical-shaped, poly-dispersed NCs and size ranging from 18.59 to 141.77 nm with the average size of 61.19 ± 3.89 nm (
Fig. 4
A–B). Furthermore, the EDS analysis confirmed the co-existence of metals such as Ag, Mg, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen (
Fig. 4
C–I). The size of the NCs found to be higher than the Ag/MgO NPs due to the involvement of the XG and AVE in the formation of the NCs. Also, the size of both nanomaterials was found to be lesser than that observed by DLS analysis. These size differences might be attributed due to the contraction in samples preparation for TEM while the DLS measures the hydrodynamic diameter size of nanomaterials and the results indicated that the NCs/NPs have the high water absorption ability to result in the swelling in nanomaterials and size increment in DLS analysis comparing to TEM analysis
