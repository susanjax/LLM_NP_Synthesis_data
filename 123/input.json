Green synthesis of iron nanoparticles
The biosynthesis of iron nanoparticles was carried out by adding slowly 3 mL aqueous extract from roots of Picrorhiza kurroa to 50 mL solution of aq. ferric nitrate along with constant stirring at 80 Â°C. Within 15 min. the light brown colour of the reaction mixture turned to wine red colour and after 10 min. the solution became dark. No any change in colour of the reaction mixture was observed after 24 hrs. (Fig. 1a, 1b, 1c).
Characterisation of biosynthesized iron nanoparticles
The synthesis of iron nanoparticles is further revealed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The resulting diffraction patterns are compared with the standard patterns to get the final information, which clearly indicated the presence of iron oxide nanoparticles with hexagonal Rhomb-Centered geometry. XRD pattern includes some unassigned peaks which may be of fewer bio compounds (Fig. 4).
