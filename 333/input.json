Synthesis of silver nanoparticles
For the synthesis of the silver nanoparticles, a certain volume of the olive leaf extract (0.2–9) ml was added to the AgNO3 solution and the volume was adjusted to 10 ml with de-ionized water. The final concentration of Ag+ was 1 × 10−3 M. The solution was stirred for 2 min. The reduction process Ag+ to Ag0 nanoparticles was followed by the color change of the solution from yellow to brownish-yellow to deep brown depending on parameters studied such as the extract concentration, temperature and pH. The nanoparticles were prepared at different pH values, the pH of the solutions was adjusted using 0.1 N H3PO4 or 0.1 N NaOH solutions.
 X-ray diffraction (XRD)
Fig. 8 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of dried silver nanoparticles synthesized using olive leaf extract at room temperature. The XRD patterns of Ag/extract indicated that the structure of silver nanoparticles is face-centered cubic (fcc) (Shameli et al., 2010). In addition, the XRD peaks at 2θ of 38.17°, 44.31°, 64.44°, 77.34° and 81.33° could be attributed to the 111, 200, 220, 311 and 222 crystallographic planes. A peak was also observed at 2θ equal 22 suggesting that the crystallization of bio-organic phase occurs on the surface of the silver nanoparticles (Sathyavathi et al., 2010). Hence from the XRD pattern it is clear that AgNPs formed using olive leaf broth were essentially crystalline.
As the concentration of the olive leaf extract increases, the absorption peak gets more sharpness and blue shift was observed from 458 to 441 nm. This blue shift indicates a reduction in the mean diameter of the silver nanoparticles. The blue shifted and sharp narrow shape SPR band indicating the formation of spherical and homogeneous distribution of silver nanoparticles was observed. This was further confirmed by TEM images of leaf extract mixed samples using 1 and 5 ml extract at room temperature after 24 h incubation, Fig. 2. The results indicate that the average particle size of the synthesized silver nanoparticles is highly influenced by the concentration of leaf broth. Increasing leaf extract concentration in the reaction mixture decreases the particle size. At lower extract concentrations (1 ml extract), quasi spherical nanoparticles were formed with an average size of 30 ± 6 nm (Fig. 2a), together with some small particles in the range of 7–15 nm. On the other hand, at higher extract concentrations (5 ml), the majority of the Ag nanoparticles were in the range of 8–15 nm (Fig. 2b). This indicates that low quantities of the extract can reduce silver ions, but do not protect most of the quasi-spherical nanoparticles from aggregating because of the deficiency of biomolecules to act as protecting agents. On the other hand, at higher extract concentrations the biomolecules act as reducing agent and cap the nanoparticle surfaces protecting them from aggregation. Similar studies showed that a comparatively higher extract ratio is responsible for the synthesis of symmetrical nanoparticles (Sosa et al., 2003).
