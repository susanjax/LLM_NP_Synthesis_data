Synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs)
Zinc oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple and fast co-precipitation method. ZnO nanoparticles were obtained by modification of the method described by Wang et al. (
Wang et al., 2021
). In a typical procedure, 0.08 mol of zinc nitrate (1.19 g) was dissolved in 30 mL deionized water under vigorous stirring at room temperature, and then ammonium hydroxide (25% w/w) was added until the solution becomes pH12 and milky color. The final milky product was washed with DI water and ethanol three times, and dried at 70 ℃ for 24 h. The final ZnO nanoparticles were obtained by calcining at 500 ℃ for 3 h. The mechanism of zinc oxide preparation through the reaction of ammonium hydroxide with dissolved Zn2+ ions can be summarized as follow:
The purity, crystallinity and phase of the synthesized products were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. XRD patterns of ZnO and ZnO-Ag nanoparticles are shown in

Fig. 2
a with crystal structure as the hexagonal phase of the zinc oxide nanoparticles with unit cell parameters a = 3.25, b = 3.25, c = 5.2, p63mc space group (JCPDS No. 01–080-0075). Eleven major reflection peaks are showed at 2θ = 31.88°, 34.55°, 36.38°, 47.67°, 56.7°, 62.97°, 66.49°, 68.05°, 69.18°, 72.67°, and 75.35° that can be attributed to (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (2 0 0), (1 1 2), (2 0 1), (0 0 4), and (2 0 2) Miller indices (
Wali, 2019
). This pattern was matched very well to the XRD pattern of hexagonal type zinc oxide structure.

b, shows the XRD pattern of ZnO-Ag@CME NPs. In addition to the ZnO peaks, the three additional peaks at 38.23° (1 1 1), 44.37° (2 0 0), and 64.56° (2 2 0) can be related to a cubic silver structure (JCPDS No. 01-087-0717). The diffraction peaks confirmed the formation of silver nanoparticles on the ZnO surface. The results were consistent with previous studies (
Zhao et al., 2015
,
Kadam et al., 2018
). The crystallite size of the product was measured using Debye-Scherrer equation: D (nm) = 0.9λ/βCosθ (6); where β is the FWHM (Full width at half maximum), λ is X-ray wavelength of Cu-Kα (1.5406 Å), and θ is the diffraction angle of the particles. The average size of pure ZnO and ZnO-Ag@CME NPs was determined to be 33.8 and 49.6 nm, respectively.

The size and shape analysis of the prepared pure ZnO and ZnO-Ag were performed using field emission electron microscopy (FESEM), which is illustrated in
Fig. 4
.

a and b exhibits the FESEM images of pure ZnO nanoparticles synthesized by co-precipitate method at various magnifications. Spherical morphology, small nanoparticles (in size range of 35–50 nm) with regular and homogenous structures was the characteristics of ZnO nanoparticles. Morphology and particle size of ZnO-Ag prepared by C. monogyna extract are shown in
Fig. 4
c and d. No remarkable changes in the shape were noticed when silver was modified on the surface of zinc oxide nanoparticles. The FESEM results showed the spherical-like morphology, good disperse, regular and small size with an average size of about 60 ± 5.5 nm. The elemental composition analysis of the synthesized ZnO and ZnO-Ag nanoparticles was further confirmed by the EDS technique (
Fig. 5
). The lines of Zn, O, and Ag are observed (
Attia et al., 2020
). The EDS analysis also confirmed that silver nanoparticles are completely modified on the zinc oxide surface. For further investigation, transmission electron microscopy analysis was applied to study the morphology and size of the products (ZnO and ZnO-Ag nanoparticles) (
Fig. 6
). The TEM images exhibited that the pure ZnO (
Fig. 6
a) and ZnO-Ag@CME NPs (
Fig. 6
b and c) were spherical, uniform and the sizes of these samples were 35–50 and 55–70 nm, respectively.
