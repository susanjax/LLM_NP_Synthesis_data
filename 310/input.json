Synthesis of branched AuAg
All chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers. Firstly, add 10 mM HAuCl4 dropwise to the 0.1 mM PC solution and continue stirring for 20 min to form a purple-red gold seed solution. Next, branched AuAg NPs were prepared at room temperature using Au seeds as raw materials. Briefly, 4 mL of freshly prepared Au seed solution was added to 10 mL of deionized water. Under vigorous stirring, 100 mM of HAuCl4, 6 mM of AgNO3, 30 mM of HQ and 12.5 mM of PVP solution were mixed and stirred into the reaction system. Then, ddH2O was added up to 20 mL and maintained for 1 h to obtain stable and uniformly branched AuAg NPs.
Synthesis of AuAg@PC-Fe
MPN coating was obtained on AuAg NPs by vortex-mixing 1 mL of AuAg NP dispersion with 50 μL of PC solution (5 mM) for 10 s. Then, 15 μL FeCl3 solution (25 mM) was added and stirred for 10 s. Subsequently, NaOH was added dropwise to raise the pH of the suspension to 7.8. The resulting MPN-coated AuAg NPs were centrifuged (6000 rpm, 5 min) to collect the precipitates. The final product is referred to as AuAg@PC-Fe. The AuAg@PC-Fe combinations in which the above assembly steps were performed once, twice and three times are denoted as AuAg@PC-FeI, AuAg@PC-FeII and AuAg@PC-FeIII, respectively.
Characterization
The average diameters of AuAg, AuAg@PC-FeI, AuAg@PC-FeII and AuAg@PC-FeIII were examined via DLS, as shown in
Fig. 1
G. They were 78.2 nm, 91.28 nm, 105.7 nm and 122.4 nm, respectively.
