Preparation of GG-AgNPs
The preparation of GG-AgNPs was carried out in an aqueous medium by monowave, without the addition of any chemical reducing agent. In the synthesis process, 5 mL of aqueous solution containing AgNO3 (0.5 %) and 5 mL of aqueous solution containing GG (0.5 %) were mixed in a reaction vessel. The GG-AgNPs are prepared by varying the monowave treatment time, concentration of silver nitrate, and concentration of guar gum at 90 °C. In this synthesis process is the colorless reaction mixture was converted in to the characteristic yellow color after the monowave treatment, which indicates the formation of GG-AgNPs.

Analysis by X-ray diffraction was carried out to confirm the crystalline nature of the GG-AgNPs. A number of Brag reflections with 2 theta values of 38.06°, 46.07°, 64.26° and 76.89° corresponding to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) sets of lattice planes, respectively, are observed and are shown in
Fig. 3
, which may be indexed as the band for the FCC structure of GG-AgNPs. The peak corresponding to the (1 1 1) plane is more intense than the other planes. The deviations from ideal crystallinity, such as finite crystallite size and strain lead to broadening of the diffraction lines. The broadening of these peaks is mostly due to the effect of GG in the formation of GG-AgNPs

A transmission electron micrograph of green synthesized GG-AgNPs is shown in
Fig. 4
(a). The TEM image shows the green synthesized GG-AgNPs are in spherical and well distributed in the GG polymer matrix. To get the size distributions of green synthesized GG-AgNPs, approximately 80 particles were counted and then converted into histograms.
Fig. 4
(b) presents a histogram of the particle size distribution of the GG-AgNPs. Histogram shows the average particle size of GG-AgNPs is 5 ± 2 nm. The selected area electron diffraction pattern of GG-AgNPs was presented in
Fig. 5
, which is exhibited as polycrystalline diffraction rings, which can be indexed to cubic-phase of silver metal, indicative of that these nanoparticles are crystalline metallic silver
