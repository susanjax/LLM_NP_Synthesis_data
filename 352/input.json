Preparation of Ag@CFR
As shown in Fig. 1, Ag@CFR were synthesized via the hydrothermal method utilizing catechol, HMT, and AgNO3 as precursors. In brief, varying amounts of AgNO3 (1, 2, and 5 mmol) were severally added to 400 mL of deionized water. Subsequently, a solution composed of 10 mmol HMT and 20 mmol catechol was gradually introduced into the aforementioned solution. The mixture was then violently stirred at room temperature for 30 min until a homogeneous dark solution was obtained. Then, the solution was severally transferred into a 500 mL Teflon-sealed stainless-steel autoclave, which was then heated in an oven at 160 °C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, some precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed several times using deionized water. Finally, Ag@CFR were obtained as a dark powder after drying under 80 °C for 12 h. Ag@CFR prepared by using molar ratios of catechol to AgNO3 of 20:1, 10:1, and 4:1 are denoted as Ag@CFR-1, Ag@CFR-2, and Ag@CFR-3, respectively.
Fig. 2A1, 2B1, and 2C1 severally present the digital photos of the aqueous dispersion and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of Ag@CFR-1, Ag@CFR-2, and Ag@CFR-3. We can see that the utilization of ultrasonic dispersion enables the uniform dispersion of all samples in water, resulting in the attainment of a homogeneous and stable black-brown solution. Ag@CFR-1, Ag@CFR-2, and Ag@CFR-3 mostly displayed as uniformly distributed monodispersing microspheres, while some of the microspheres connected to form bigger particles. In addition, the size distribution of the microsphere was determined using a particle size analyzer, as shown in Fig. 2A2, 2B2, and 2C2. Ag@CFR-1, Ag@CFR-2, and Ag@CFR-3 severally had a diameter of around 712, 825, and 1110 nm. This suggests that Ag@CFR with a higher ratio of catechol and AgNO3 show better dispersibility in the solution and thus result in a smaller size. As shown in Fig. 2A3, Ag@CFR-1 showed an intact microsphere having a smooth and clean surface without any significant depositions. In contrast, as presented in Fig. 2B3 and 2C3, some nanoscale particles with a size of about 6 nm appeared on the surface of Ag@CFR-2, while some bigger particles with a diameter of around 22 nm randomly distributed on the surface of Ag@CFR-3. Besides, based on the inductively coupled plasma inductively coupled plasma (ICP-OES) test results presented in Fig. S1, Ag@CFR-1, Ag@CFR-2, and Ag@CFR-3 exhibited high silver concentrations of 16.19, 47.24, and 82.41 g/kg, respectively.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were carried out to investigate the state of the specific element. Fig. 3D depicts the XRD spectrum of Ag@CFR-2, which has five peaks at 2θ = 38.0, 44.2, 64.2, 77.3, and 81.4, severally corresponding to the Miller indices (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), and (2 2 2). This thus confirms the presence of face-centered cubic structured Ag NPs both on the surface and within the microsphere [38], [39]. Fig. 3E shows the XPS full survey spectrum of Ag@CFR-2, in which C, O, and Ag were severally identified with an atomic content of 78.5 %, 19.8 %, and 1.7 %. Besides, the Ag3d high-resolution spectrum of the microsphere (Fig. 3F) showed a double band corresponding to Ag3d3/2 and Ag3d5/2, which had two strong peaks at 374.5 and 368.6 eV with a doublet splitting of about 6.0 eV and two weak peaks at 374.1 and 368.1 eV. It indicates that the majority of Ag atoms in Ag@CFR-2 exist in their elemental state, while some of them are present in an oxidation state [40], [41]. Fig. 3G shows that the C1s spectrum of Ag@CFR-2 was divided into three peaks at 288.7, 285.6, and 284.6 eV, which were severally assigned to O-C = O, C-O, and C-C of the catechol-derived resin (CFR) [42], [43]. Also, the chemical structure of Ag@CFR-2 was determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as depicted in Fig. S3, confirming the successful synthesis of the CFR as we anticipated.
