Synthesis of silver nanoparticles
The primary goal of the paper was to investigate physicochemical properties and the bioactivity of the nanoparticles obtained in the presence of different natural extracts. Thus, during preparation of the extracts we followed the main steps of the synthesis conditions given in the literature (Castillo-López and Pal, 2014, Al-Kalifawi et al., 2015, Khalilzadeh and Borzoo, 2016, Ali et al., 2015, Siemieniec and Kruk, 2013, Kaviya et al., 2011, Ali et al., 2016).
For Ag nanoparticles synthesis AgNO3 and acetone were purchased from Avantor (Performance Materials, Gliwice, Poland). All fruits and vegetables were purchased from the local grocery store.
For all solutions, the pH value was measured, and the obtained values are presented in Table 1.

Potato extract
Chopped potatoes (200 g) were boiled in 1L of demineralized water at 90 °C for 15 min. For synthesis, 100 ml of potato extract was added to 100 ml of 0.01 mol/L AgNO3. The solution was incubated for 24 h at room temperature (RT) (Castillo-López & Pal, 2014). After this time, the solution was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. The precipitate was washed in acetone and left to air dry (pH 6.2).

Garlic extract
Fresh garlic (200 g) was peeled, washed and incubated at 25 °C in 100 ml of distilled water for 24 h. The final obtained solution was filtered. 30 ml an aqueous solution of 0.01 mol/L AgNO3 was added dropwise into 30 ml of plant extract and vigorously stirred. The solution was then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. The separated nanoparticles settled at the bottom were collected and washed by acetone. The obtained precipitate was dried at RT for 24 h (Al-Kalifawi et al., 2015) (pH 5.6).
•
White onion extract
Fresh white onion (25 g) was peeled, washed and boiled in 100 ml distilled water for 10 min. The received extract was then filtered. The onion extract (10 ml) was mixed with 10 ml of AgNO3 (0.01 mol/L). The obtained solution was stirred at 60 °C for 1 h and then incubated for 24 h at RT (Khalilzadeh & Borzoo, 2016). The final product was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. The precipitate was washed in acetone (pH 5.8).
•
Radish extract
Radish (25 g) was used to prepare the extract used in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The radish was washed with water and cut into small pieces. The radish was boiled in 150 ml of distilled water for 10 min. The solution was filtered, and 10 ml of extract was mixed with 10 ml of 0.01 mol/L of AgNO3. The final product was incubated for 24 h at RT (Ali et al., 2015) and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min to obtain a powder sample. The precipitate was washed in acetone and left to air dry (pH 5.5).
•
Red pepper extract
The red pepper was sliced into small pieces, and the juice was mechanically drained. 30 ml of 0.01 mol/L of AgNO3 was added to 30 ml of freshly prepared red pepper extract. The solution was intensively stirred for 30 min until the color changed to brown. The mixture was then incubated for 24 h at RT (Siemieniec & Kruk, 2013). Then the solution was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min to obtain Ag nanoparticles as a precipitate. The precipitate was then washed in acetone and left overnight to dry (pH 5.1).
•
Orange extract
Prior to synthesis, the oranges were washed in demineralized water. Then, 4 g of fruit peel was added to 40 ml of demineralized water. The solution was boiled at 100 °C for 2 min. The received extract was then filtered off. For synthesis, 5 ml of the solution was used and mixed with AgNO3 (0.01 mol/L) in volume ratio 1:1 (Kaviya et al., 2011). The resulting suspension was left for 24 h for incubation; after this time, the product was isolated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. The precipitate was purified in acetone and left to air dry (pH 4.0).
•
Apple extract
Fresh apples (100 g) were sliced into small pieces. Then, 200 ml of demineralized water was added, and the solution was heated for 1 h at 80 °C. The resulting product was filtered. Next 10 ml of apple extract was added to 10 ml of an aqueous solution of 0.01 mol/L AgNO3 for particle synthesis. The mixture was placed on a magnetic stirrer, heated at 60 °C for 1 h and then left for 24 h at RT for incubation (Ali et al., 2016). The next day, the product was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min and dried to powder form (pH 2.1).

The structure of metallic silver has regular symmetry and is centered on the walls. The experimentally determined silver lattice parameter ranges from 4.062 to 4.090 ± 0.002 Å (Mehta et al., 2017). The structure of the silver chloride lattice also has regular fcc symmetry, and the lattice parameter, according to the literature is: 5.549 Å, while the experimentally determined ranges are from 5.490 to 5.532 Å (Mehta et al., 2017). Each silver ion inside the lattice is bound to six chloride ions, and each chloride ion inside the lattice is also bound to six silver ions. The ions on the surface or at the edges of the lattice have a partial charge due to fewer bonds. For example, the silver ion has a partial positive charge on its surface, which makes the surface of silver chloride an active site for further chemical and physical interactions (Mehta et al., 2017).
