Synthesis of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (FMNPs) and annealed NPs
Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by reducing iron (III) chloride by pine needle leaves aqueous extract. In summary, various percentages of pine needle leaf extract were prepared by adding different amounts of its powder (0.5–10 g) to 100 mL of hot water (∼90 °C) and stirring with a magnetic stirrer until it was cooled to room temperature (about 30 min). Separately, a 0.5 mol L−1 of FeCl3.6H2O solution was prepared. All solutions were bubbled with nitrogen for 20 min to eliminate the dissolved oxygen. Then, 0.5 M FeCl3.6H2O and pine leaf extract solutions in a 1:5 vol ratio were mixed under the nitrogen atmosphere for 5 min and kept overnight to complete the reaction. In the next step, 10 mL of 25% ammonia solution was added to 100 mL of the prepared mixture and incubated at 80 °C in a water bath for 20 min with mechanical stirring (300 rpm). Finally, the synthesized magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were collected on a filter, washed with water, and dried at room temperature. The annealed NPs were prepared by processing an aliquot of the synthesized nanoparticles at 500 °C for 30 min in a furnace.
Characterization of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles and annealed NPs
The XRD patterns of FMNPs are shown in Fig. 2. Peaks appearing at 2q values of 35.62° and 62.8° agree with the standard's values (JCPDS card No. 39-1346) [28], indicating that FMNPs contain pure cubic spinel crystal of magnetic iron oxide. The crystalline structure of FMNPs confirms by two distinct diffraction lines; however, the broadening shapes are attributed to biological components [32].
The morphology and size of pine-iron oxide nanoparticles were studied using transmission electron microscopy. The morphology of the magnetic nanoparticles exhibited an approximately spherical shape with a size in the range of 12–37 nm (Fig. 3A). The TEM image also showed the formation of larger aggregates resulting from the aggregation of smaller nanoparticles. The accumulation of smaller nanoparticles is attributed to the biological properties of the material [33]. The size distribution histogram measured from the TEM image indicated that the mean particle size is 22 nm (Fig. 3B).
