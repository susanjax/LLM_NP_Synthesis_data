Synthesis of gold nanoparticles by citrate thermal reduction method.
Ultrapure deionized water was used throughout the
experiments. Gold colloids were prepared by citrate
thermal reduction method (Yang et al. 2005).
Typically in the process of thermal reduction, a gold
sol was prepared by adding 1ml of 1 wt% HAuCl4
aqueous solution and 1.5 ml of 38.8mM sodium citrate
aqueous solution into 90 ml boiling water. The citrate
ion acts as both a reductant and stabilizer. After the
solution had turned purple red within 30s, the solution
was cooled quickly in the ice bath. This resulted in a
stable dispersion of gold particles with an average
diameter of around 13.2 nm and 10% polydispersity
(Yang et al. 2003 and Yang et al. 2005).
Characterization of gold nanoparticles.
Figure 1 shows TEM image of the obtained gold
nano particles. As seen in Figure (1), the prepared
gold nanoparticles were almost spherical shape, and
separated from each other. The particle size is mainly
in the range of 11–22 nm. It is also noted that the
nanoparticles in the gold nanoclusters were nearly
individually isolated.
Figure 2 presents the UV–vis absorption spectra
of the prepared gold sols, in which the 530 nm
absorption bands were characteristic of the surface
plasmon bands of gold nanoparticles of 11–22 nm.
