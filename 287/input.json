Preparation of AML and AML@AgNPs
The AML was synthesized according to a previously reported method [
33
]. The purified AL was dissolved in 20 wt.% NaOH aqueous solution to adjust the pH to 12, and then it was heated to 80 ± 5 °C. Subsequently, 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyltri methylammonium chloridechloride (CHMAC) was added to the solution, after which the reaction was allowed to proceed for 4 h. Afterward, the reaction solution was purified using a dialyzer with a cutoff molecular weight of 3500 Da to obtain AML. Four AML samples with CHMAC -to -AL weight ratios of 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 were prepared and named as AML-20, AML-30, AML-50, and AML-80, respectively. The AML sample (0.4997 g) was dissolved in 9.5 mL of water (1 g/L), and its pH was adjusted to above the isoelectric point. The AgNO3 solution (0.5 mL of 400 mg/L) was added to the above solution, and the reaction was left to proceed under microwave irradiation at 60 °C for 10 min. Afterward, a few drops of diluted nitric acid were added to the reaction product to adjust the product to pH 3. The obtained lignin-based AgNPs were dialyzed until no white precipitate of silver chloride was observed in the washing fluid. Finally, AML@AgNPs were obtained via freeze drying.

The morphologies of the AML-20@AgNPs samples were further characterized via TEM (
Fig. 3
).
Fig. 3
(a and 3b) shows the TEM images of AML-20@AgNPs prepared at pH 7. TEM analysis using Image J software gave the average particle size distribution (inset in
Fig. 3
a) to be 24.7 ± 4.7 nm. The formed AgNPs were almost spherical, and were uniformly embedded in the AML-20 structure. During the formation of the AML-20@AgNPs, the AgNPs were wrapped with a 3D network structure of lignin macromolecule to control the AgNPs growth [
28
].
Fig. 3
(c and 3d) shows the TEM images of AML-20@AgNPs prepared at pH 9. The average particle size distribution (inset in
Fig. 3
c) to be 26.1 ± 6.8 nm. Under these conditions, the AML-20@AgNPs severely aggregated; therefore, pH 7 was selected to prepare AML-20@AgNPs under microwave irradiation.

X-ray diffraction patterns of the AML-20 and AML-20@AgNPs are shown in
Fig. 4
. The main diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 38.11°, 44.32°, 64.37°, and 77.39°. These peaks, corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (311) lattice planes of Ag, were the same as those in JCPDS data (No. 65–2871) [
35
], indicating that the AgNPs existed in a crystalline state. According to the Scherrer formula D = Kλ/βcosθ, the average size of the AgNPs was calculated to be approximately 40 nm, where D represents the particle diameter, λ represents the XRD wavelength, β represents the half-peak width, and θ represents the diffraction angle.
