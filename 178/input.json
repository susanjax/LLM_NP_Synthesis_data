3.1. Preparation of Cissus rotundifolia leaf extract
Cissus rotundifolia plant leaves (60 g) were washed with distilled water, dried and chopped into small pieces, ground, and boiled for 40 min at 80–90 °C with 400 mL distilled water in a 500 mL round bottle flask using Soxhlet apparatus, and maintained at room temperature. The resultant solution was strained to eradicate any solid content and finally filtered via Whatman filter paper. The resulting filtrate was stored at 5 °C in a refrigerator for further fabrication of CuFe2O4 NPs [37], [38].
3.2. Green fabrication of CuFe2O4 NPs
(Cu(NO3)2.3 H2O) (0.05 M) and Fe(NO3)3.9 H2O (0.1 M) solutions were prepared separately. 30 mL of the plant extract was added to 20 mL of the mixture containing 10 mL copper nitrate and 10 mL ferric nitrate and stirred on a mechanical stirrer for 2 h. Ammonia solution was added slowly to maintain the pH at 8. The mixing process was continued on a magnetic stirrer to homogenize the solution. The temperature was increased and fixed at 90 °C. After continuous stirring a gel was formed [39], [40], [41]
. After a while, the gel converted into a dry gel (Xerogel) which was thermally calcined at 650 °C for 3 h to obtain well-crystallized CuFe2O4 NPs. The preparatory scheme is given as in Fig. 1 and the concerned reactions are represented in 
Fig. 2.
Characterization 
The XRD analysis of CuFe2O4 NPs (
Fig. 4
) showed peaks at 2θ = 29.86°, 35.43°, 38.74°, 43.11°, 56.90°, and 62.28°, ascribed to the (220), (311), (222), (400), (511) and (440) hkl planes and matched with Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS No. 25–0283) and in alignment with the previously reported literature in which the pristine CuFe2O4 NPs exhibited a well-defined crystalline structure, with peaks at 2θ = 29.90°, 35.39°, 38.86°, 43.03°, 57.18°, and 62.58° ascribed to the (220), (311), (222), (400), (511) and (440) spinel planes 
[49]
. The fine diffraction pattern showed the formation of well-crystalline NPs. The mean crystallite size (D) of the CuFe2O4 NPs was measured using the Scherrer 
Eq. (3)
 
[50]
.
Diluted drops of CuFe2O4 NPs were dispersed in ethanol on carbon-coated Cu grids to prepare the sample for TEM analysis. The sample was then allowed to dry at room temperature . The TEM image of CuFe2O4 NPs is illustrated in 
Fig. 8
(a) showing a roughly spherical shape and irregular morphology 
[55]
. The synthesized CuFe2O4 NPs showed distinct particles with no agglomeration (
Fig. 8
(a, b). The particle size was calculated using 
Fig. 8
(a) showing an average particle size of 24 nm (
Fig. 8
(c)). TEM studies and the Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) pattern showed the crystallinity of the NPs as depicted in 
Fig. 8
(d). The average particle size of CuFe2O4 NPs was found to be larger than the average crystallite size estimated from the XRD analysis 
[56]
.
