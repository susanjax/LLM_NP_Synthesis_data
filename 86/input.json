Synthesis of ZnO-NPs
In the present study, we used the FCF as reducing agent to reduce zinc sulfate (ZnSO4). Hundred ml of FCF was taken in each different Erlenmeyer flask and mixed with zinc sulfate solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) solution (1 mM final concentration). The FCF containing flask was agitated for 24 h at room temperature. Simultaneously, only the culture filtrate of A. alternata and only zinc sulfate solution were maintained under same conditions. The reaction mixture was routinely monitored by visual color change.

The ZnO-NPs were separated out by centrifugation at 12,000g for 10 min, and the settled nanoparticles were washed with deionized water (three times). The purified ZnO-NPs were resuspended in deionized water and ultrasonicated by Piezo-u-sonic ultrasonic cleaner (Pus-60w). Synthesis of ZnO-NPs was repeated for three times (n = 3) and subsequently utilized for characterization of the particles.
Characterization of ZnO NPs
Particle size was determined by dynamic light scattering measurement. Laser diffraction revealed that particle size obtained in the range of 45â€“150 nm (Fig. 1).
