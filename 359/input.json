Synthesis of copper nanoparticles
1 mM aqueous solution of copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) was prepared using ultra purified deionized water that was used as the stock solution for the biosynthesis of copper nanoparticles, and 50 mL of this salt solution was taken with 100 mL orange juice extract (in 1:2 ratios). Then, the mixture was subjected to the laboratory-grade microwave closed vessel (Milestone Microsynth microwave labstation; Frequency: 220 V/50-60 Hz, 3.5 kW) system for 5 min at 700 W. Afterward, the solution was placed again into the microwave system with constant stirring by a magnetic stirrer, and the heating was continued for 10 min until a dark blackish brown colloid was formed which indicated the copper nanoparticle formation and the completion of the reaction.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) study
The biosynthesized copper nanoparticles using freshly squeezed orange juice extract were characterized via Transmission Electron Microscopy to evaluate the detail morphology and size distribution of these NPs. TEM profile of biosynthesized CuNPs reveals that the monodisperse particles are morphologically roughly round in shape. Also, diameter measurements by TEM show the histogram of 100 randomly selected particles obtained from the analysis of CuNPs with an average particle diameter of 10.2 nm (Fig. 6).
An X-ray diffraction study was conducted for revealing the existence of crystallinity in the phytosynthesized CuNPs by using the extracts of Citrus sinensis (Fig. 7). Five significant reflections were observed at 43.49°, 50.64°, 74.38°, 90.25° and 95.48° which are relatively consistent for the standard spectrum of the metallic Cu [38]. Besides, the interplanar spacing (dcalculated) values are 2.084, 1.806, 1.277, 1.090 and 1.043 Å which confirmed five strong reflections, consistent with the planes of (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222), respectively. These planes are the characteristic Bragg's diffraction plans for copper with face-centered cubic crystalline structures which support or coordinate the standard database of the JCPDS (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards) file no: 04-0784 [39]. The lattice constant (a) nm and crystallite size of nanoparticles were calculated as 0.3610 of 14.8 nm, respectively [40]. Also, XRD profile shows a weak and broad reflection at ~36° marked with an asterisk (*) indicate the presence of minute amount of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) = 36.5°. This is perhaps due to the fact that the metallic copper nanoparticles are very sensitive to the air, and trend to be oxidized easily. The biosynthesized CuNPs were exposed to the open air for a short period of time while transferring inside the XRD chamber during the sample loading into the instrument [41,42]. That might cause this minute amount of oxidation of biosynthesized CuNPs.
