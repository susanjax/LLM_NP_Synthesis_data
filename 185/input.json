Synthesis of Ag/TiO2, Ag/ZnO and Ag/Fe2O3 films
Block copolymer surfactant (F-127) EO106-PO70EO106, EO=-CH2CH2O-, PO=-CH2(CH3)CHO-), MW 12600 g/mol), served as a structure-directing agent. Ti(OC(CH3)3)4 (TBOT), C2H5OH, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O ferric nitrate nonahydrate, HCl, and CH3COOH were procured from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. This solution was prepared by dissolving 2.9 g diethyl amine (DEA) and 2.3 mL TiCL4 in ethanol (20 mL). Another solution was prepared separately by dissolving 1.3 g Pluronic F127 in absolute ethanol (21 mL). These two solutions were stirred, heated to 65°C, and mixed. The final Ti: DEA: F127: ethanol molar ratio is 1:1:0.005:34. The resulting mixture was stirred at 65°C for 90 min to obtain a homogeneous and transparent solution, which was then aged at room temperature for 24 h. The sol was deposited on soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates (20 mm × 30 mm) by dip-coating. ZnO and Fe2O3 sols were prepared by a similar procedure with changing their precursors, zinc acetate and Ferric nitrate, respectively.

3. Coating of TiO2, ZnO and Fe2O3 films on the SLG
To achieve uniform, defect-free deposition, the SLG must be free of dust and other particles, and it must be uniformly wetted to the sol-gel solution. The SLG was cleaned well by sonication in distilled water for 15 min and then washed with acetone. Then SLG was dried in the oven at 80°C to be ready for coatings. The SLG slides were coated with the sol prepared at the withdrawal rate of 1 mm/s. After ageing in the air for 24 h, the samples were calcined in air at 450°C for 4 h (heating rate: 1°C/min). Multiple coated films were prepared by repeating the deposition process and heated at 350°C for 1 h before the subsequent coating step to obtain multilayers of TiO2, ZnO and Fe2O3 1L, 2L and 3L. Finally, the films were calcined at 450°C for 4 h. The calcined films were successively immersed in aqueous solutions of silver nitrate 0.005 M AgNO3 solution for 5 min under UVA illumination in the presence of 1% (v/v) methanol/H2O. The films were rinsed carefully with deionized water after each immersion and dried at 80°C overnight.

Characterization
Nanocrystalline pristine one layer (1 L), two layers (2 L), and three layers (3 L) ZnO, Fe2O3 and TiO2, films and Ag/deposited ZnO, TiO2, and Fe2O3 (1 L), (2 L), and (3 L) were deposited on SLG substrates by the dip-coating approach from aqueous sols, and The obtained films were calcined at 450°C. The obtained Ag deposited onto the pristine (1 L), (2 L), and (3 L) ZnO, TiO2, and Fe2O3 films on SLG substrates. All synthesized films were optically transparent and crack-free, as illustrated in the SEM images (
Fig. 1
a–i). SEM micrographs of the synthesized films indicated that the obtained films have a flat and smooth surface (
Fig. 1
a–i). The Ag nanoparticles deposited on ZnO layers indicated that Ag NPs do not have a uniform surface, while many Ag particles in uniform size are clearly demonstrated (
Fig. 1
a–c). The Ag NPs in Ag/TiO2 (1L), Ag/TiO2 (2L), and Ag/TiO2 (3L) exhibited that the Ag NPs in Ag/TiO2 (1L) film was composed of homogeneous particles with about 100 nm in diameters (
Fig. 1
d). However, Ag NPs in Ag/TiO2 (1L) and Ag/TiO2 (2L) films were observed in spherical shapes with agglomeration (
Fig. 1
e,f). Ag NPs deposited on Fe2O3 layers could be obtained as shown in 
Fig. 1
g–i. The figures indicated that the film has a uniform surface with different surface morphologies. The Ag NPs were highly distributed on Fe2O3 films with spherical shapes with 100 nm diameter. The different surface morphologies determined the outcome of photocatalytic activity for antibacterial applications in the photocatalytic evaluation section. The thickness of the first layer of TiO2, ZnO, and Fe2O3 films was measured by profilometry at about 258, 267, and 283 nm, respectively, which were increased to 684, 638, and 688 nm at three-layered films (
Table 1
). The surface area has been reported to increase practically linearly with the increasing number of coatings, which agrees with the linear increase in thickness.
The phasic structure of the synthesized (1 L), (2 L), and (3 L) TiO2, ZnO, and Fe2O3 films and Ag/deposited layers were synthesized on SLG substrates were conducted by the XRD, as displayed in 
Fig. 2
a–f. The XRD diffraction patterns for pristine ZnO NPs at different layers (1L, 2L, and 3L) and Ag/ZnO at different layers (1L, 2L, and 3L) were demonstrated in 
Fig. 2
a,b. The results demonstrated that the peaks of pure mesoporous ZnO NPs appeared at 31.78°, 34.45°, 36.49°, 47.48°, 56.64°, 62.77°, and 67.95° matching with the planes of (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), and (200) for ZnO hexagonal structure (JCPDS files 89–1397), respectively (

[32]
. 
Fig. 2
b exhibited that Ag/ZnO at different layers (1L, 2L and 3L) were synthesized on SLG substrates, which were displayed in 
Fig. 2
b. The peak intensity and position of ZnO NPs for all synthesized Ag/1L, 2L, and 3L ZnO are similar to the pristine ZnO films. However, the intensity of Ag (111), (200) and (220), positioned at 2θ = 38.16°, 44.4° and 64.26°, corresponding to the formation of Ag nanocrystalline. The intensity of the Ag (111) peak for the film exhibits a remarkable increment with the increase in multilayer films. Besides, no other peaks were observed, suggesting that both samples contained a single phase of ZnO and Ag and no impurities within the samples. There are four main high-intensity peaks for the anatase TiO2 structure at 2θ = 37.92°, 48.22°, 54.68°, and 63.05° indexed as (004), (200), (105), and (211) diffraction (JCPDS, No. 21-1272) 
[33]
, as shown in 
Fig. 2
c. The peaks corresponding to the rutile phase match with JCPDS Card No: 21-1276. The results were also comparable with the other reports of rutile TiO2. The position of 2θ at 27.42° and 54.33° corresponds to Miller indices of (110) and (211) planes, respectively. 
Fig. 2
d exhibited that Ag NPs were deposited on TiO2 at different layers (1L, 2L, and 3L). The peak intensity and position of TiO2 for all synthesized Ag/1L, 2L, and 3L TiO2 are similar to the pristine TiO2 films. However, the intensity of Ag (111), (200), and (220) positioned at 2θ = 38.16°, 44.4° and 64.26°, corresponding to the formation of Ag nanocrystalline. The intensity of the Ag (111) peak for the film exhibits a remarkable increment with the increased multilayer films. The XRD diffraction patterns for pristine Fe2O3 NPs at different layers (1L, 2L, and 3L) and Ag/Fe2O3 NPs at different layers (1L, 2L, and 3L) are demonstrated in 
Fig. 2
e,f. As shown in the figure, the XRD patterns of the two samples are similar, with all diffraction peaks well matched to the rhombohedral hematite structure (JCPDS card no. 33-0664). The diffraction peaks at 24.1, 54.1, 57.6, 62.4, and 64.0 are ascribed to the (012), (116), (018), (214), and (300), respectively. Also, the diffraction peaks at 31.78 and 54.56 are ascribed to the (220) and (221) well-matched to γ-Fe2O3. The diffraction peaks in these samples included two phases α-Fe2O3 and γ-Fe2O3 
[34]
. Enhanced peak intensity suggests an increased amount of nanocrystallite phase immobilized on the SLG substrates due to the increased ZnO, TiO2, and Fe2O3 film thickness (
Table 1
).
