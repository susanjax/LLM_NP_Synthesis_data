Synthesis and characterization of the PAA-CMCS-Au hydrogel
Chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) was first reduced with positively-charged 4,6-diamino-2-pyrimidinethiol (DAPT) to obtain UsAuNPs. PAA-CMCS-Au hydrogel was then synthesized from Acrylic Acid (AAc) using one-pot method, with CMCS as the crosslinking agent (
Fig. 1
a, Figure S1). AuNPs were capped by CMCS via metal-amide coordination. CMCS could also spontaneously form irregular nanoparticles in water solutions, which further exposed the surface amide groups. This characteristic would limit the self-aggregation of UsAuNPs in the solution [

]. The TEM image (Figure S2) indicated that the synthesized UsAuNPs had a diameter of 1â€“3 nm, and did not self-aggregate in the water solution. The AFM image (
Fig. 1
b) showed that the CMCS were well dispersed in the water solutions, with a particle diameter from 100 to 500 nm. Scattered CMCS NPs could fully combine with and stabilize UsAuNPs for better antibacterial effects (
