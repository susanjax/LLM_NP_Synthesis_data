Synthesis of ZnO and small rod-like ZnO nanoparticles
To synthesize ZnO NPs, 0.5 M of zinc chloride was dissolved in 50 mL of ethylene glycol and then drop-by-drop added to a 50 mL 0.5 M calcium hydroxide mixture (dispersed in a 1:1 ethylene glycol/water solution). Afterward, sodium hydroxide aqueous solution (2 M) was added dropwise to the reaction flask until the pH reached 12. The mixture was refluxed for 3 h at 100 °C. Finally, the obtained particles were centrifuged, washed three times with water, and then dried at 70 °C in the air overnight. This sample was labeled as ZnO NPs. The synthesis method of small rod-like ZnO NPs is explained in the supplementary information, Section 1.

Synthesis of negatively-charged MPA capped ZnO NPs
3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) was performed as a capping agent to synthesize carboxylate ZnO NPs through a co-precipitation process, as reported in our previous study [8]. First, 2 g of zinc chloride and 0.4 mL of MPA were dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water. Then, sodium hydroxide solution (2 M) was added dropwise to the reaction flask until the pH reached 11. The mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. Finally, the obtained particles were centrifuged, raised three times with water and then dried at 70 °C in air overnight. These NPs were named ZnO-MPA.

Synthesis of positively-charged ZnO/PEI NPs
2 g of zinc chloride and 0.1 g of polyethyleneimine (PEI) were dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water. After mixing for 20 min, a 2 M sodium hydroxide solution was dropwise added to the flask to adjust the pH value to 11. Afterward, the mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. Then, the obtained particles were separated, washed three times with water, and finally dried at 70 °C in the air overnight. These NPs were titled ZnO/PEI.

Synthesis of Ni-doped ZnO NPs
3% wt. Ni-doped ZnO NPs were produced through a co-precipitation method based on the Qamar et al. study [27]. 4.4 g of zinc acetate dihydrate and 0.174 g of nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate were dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water. Then, 5 mL of PVP solution (2%) was added. Afterward, a 2 M sodium hydroxide solution was added drop by drop to the flask to adjust the pH value to 11. The mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature, and then the particles were separated, washed three times with water and, finally dried at 75 °C in the air overnight. The calcination process was then carried out at 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 for 6 h. This sample was titled Ni-doped ZnO.

Synthesis of ZnO/GO, and ZnO/Ag/GO nanostructures
1 g of GO sheets were suspended in 200 mL of distilled water and sonicated by a bath sonicator for 30 min. Then, 1.38 g zinc chloride and 20 mL silver nitrate solution (0.1 M) were added to the mixture, followed by 30 min sonication. Afterward, sodium hydroxide solution (2 M) was added dropwise to adjust the pH value to 11. After stirring for 24 h at 60 °C, the product was centrifuged and raised with distilled water several times. Finally, the product was dried at 70 °C in the air overnight. This sample was considered ZnO/Ag/GO. ZnO/GO was produced through the same procedure without adding the AgNO3 solution.

Synthesis of ZnO/CS/Ag2O nanostructures
2 g of zinc chloride, 14 mL of silver nitrate solution (0.1 M), and 0.2 g of chitosan (CS) were dissolved in a 100 mL of 1% aqueous acetic acid solution. Then, sodium hydroxide aqueous solution (2 M) was added dropwise to adjust the pH of the solution to 12. The mixture was kept under stirring for 24 h at room temperature, and then the particles were centrifuged and raised with distilled water several times. Finally, they were dried at 70 °C in the air overnight. This structure was named ZnO/CS/Ag2O.
Characterization of the samples
The XRD analysis was performed to evaluate the crystallographic structures of the as-synthesized samples. The XRD patterns of the samples were demonstrated in Fig. 1. Based on the JCPDS file of #36-1451, the diffraction peaks appeared at about 32°, 34°, 36°, 47°, 57° and, three peaks in the range of 67°–70° belong to the hexagonal wurtzite structure of zinc oxide [29]. All the mentioned peaks can be observed in the diffraction patterns of the as-synthesized ZnO-based samples. Therefore, the formation of ZnO is confirmed. The formation mechanism of ZnO crystals from zinc chloride using a basic agent was discussed elsewhere [30].
To characterize the morphology and size of the nanostructures, FE-SEM and TEM were used, and the typical images are illustrated in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, respectively. It is well known that smaller particles have higher specific areas and can effectively interact more with the microbes. The FE-SEM images of the ZnO and ZnO-MPA samples showed the particles with a spherical shape and uniformity in shape and size. The average diameter of ZnO NPs was ∼60 nm. The core/shell structure of the ZnO-MPA NPs is obvious in the TEM image. According to the measurement of more than 100 particles, the mean particle size of the ZnO-MPA sample was ∼38 nm. Based on the SEM and TEM images, ZnO/PEI has a nanometric rod-like shape. The incorporation of capping agents or polymers may affect the nucleation and growth stages of ZnO crystals, and subsequently, the shape and size of the particles. The mean diameter and length of the particles were 40 and 100 nm, respectively. Ni-doped ZnO particles have a semi-spherical shape with an average size of 115 nm. The SEM image of the ZnO/CS/Ag2O sample demonstrated irregular-shaped aggregates composed of semi-spherical-shape particles with a size <30 nm. Regarding the ZnO/Ag/GO sample, GO sheets are visible while decorated with spindle-like ZnO/Ag aggregates. The light-gray sheets in TEM images are the GO sheets, and the dark parts, indicating the ZnO/Ag particles, are distributed among the sheets. The SEM images of small rod-like ZnO NPs and pure GO are illustrated in the supplementary information, Figs. 1 and 4, respectively.
