Green synthesis of SpE-Zn nanoparticles
The SpE-ZnNPs were synthesized according to method of Ezealisiji et al. [
18
] With modification. Aqueous zinc acetate solution was mixed with Spinach aqueous extract solution. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 ​min at 60 ​°C and incubated for 24h in the dark to avoid photo-catalysis. The resulting product was centrifuged and rinsed in double-distilled water and ethanol, respectively, before being dried and stored in an amber-colored sample vial until use.

Average particle size, morphology, and particles size distribution of SpE-ZnNPs obtained and calculated by SEM images analysis (
Fig. 1
C and D), our biosynthesis ZnO characterized as regular (uniform in the morphological shape) and spherical (granular) particle with mean diameter 13.05 ​± ​3.52 ​nm. The polydispersity index (PDI ​= ​0.07) reflects the close diameter distribution of our sample i.e. monodispersed ZnO NPs.
EDX analysis revealed the presence of the elements: Zinc, Oxygen, Calcium, Sulfur, Silicon, Phosphorus, Nitrogen, and Carbone (
Fig. 1
E), so this data confirm the ZnO formation.

Based on XRD data matched to JCPDS card N° 01-075-1526 database; crystallites structure was hexagonal (

] with 33.2% crystallinity, 90% purity, and average size (D) ​= ​12.8 ​nm; which calculated using Debye-Scherrer equation: D ​= ​k λ/β Cos ​θ, where D is the crystallite size, k is the Scherrer constant (0.9), λ is the X-ray wavelength, θ is the Bragg angle and β is full-width half maxima. XRD pattern peaks were given in (
