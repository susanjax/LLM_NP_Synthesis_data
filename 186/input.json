Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles
One hundred mL of ISP-2 medium were inoculated with a single colony of A. tucumanensis and incubated at 30 °C, 150 rpm for 72 h. Afterward, cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 x g, 15 min) and the purified cell-free supernatant was used for the biosynthesis. Nitrate reductase activity of the cell-free supernatant was determined according to the protocol described by Vaidyanathan et al. (2010). AgNO3 was added to the cell-free supernatant to a final concentration of 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 mM and incubated in the dark at 30 °C and 150 rpm for 24, 48 and 72 h. The success of the biosynthesis was assessed by scanning the absorbance (300–750 nm) in a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Multiskan SkyHigh). In addition, the change of color into yellowish-brown that indicates the formation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was monitored. The synthesized AgNPs were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 x g, 10 min), washed, resuspended in distilled water and stored at 8 °C. The concentration of AgNPs was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (Shimadzu). ISP-2 medium amended with AgNO3 was used as abiotic control. The same protocol was used for the synthesis of nanoparticles in Minimal Medium.
Characterization of silver nanoparticles
The antimicrobial capacity of nanoparticles often depends on their size. In general, smaller the nanoparticle, higher antimicrobial activity was observed (Golinska et al., 2017). DLS and SEM studies showed that most of the AgNPs had a size of 35 nm and were mostly spherical (Figures 2A and 2B). EDS analysis showed 40.4% of silver in the nanoparticle composition. The optical absorption band observed for the plasmon resonance at about 405 nm (Figure 1B) and the signal for elemental silver (3–4 keV) in the EDS spectrum (Figure 2C) were consistent with the absorption of metallic silver nanocrystallites (El-Naggar et al., 2014; Magudapathy et al., 2001). The peaks for carbon (34.6%), oxygen (19.4%) and other minor elements in the EDS spectrum suggested the presence of organic molecules associated to the AgNPs.
The XRD pattern obtained for the AgNPs is shown in Figure 3. The Bragg reflection peaks representative of the face centered cubic (fcc) of silver nanocrystals were observed (111, 200, 220 and 311 facets) (Figure 3) (Philip 2009; Shankar et al., 2003; Singh et al., 2021). The XRD pattern clearly shows that the AgNPs formed by the reduction of Ag+ ions by A. tucumanensis are metallic (Ag0) and crystalline in nature. Similar XRD patterns were observed in previous works where the crystalline structure of AgNPs was confirmed (Philip 2009; Shankar et al., 2003; Singh et al., 2021).
