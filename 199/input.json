Synthesis of AgNPs
To produce AgNPs, a newly made aqueous solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3, 1 mM) was employed. 85 mL of AgNO3 solution was combined with 15 mL of CA bark extract. AgNPs were produced at room temperature (25 ± 2.4 °C) to examine how temperature affected the process. For confirmation, the identical experiment was performed in triplicate. The color of the CA bark extract was insipid yellow, which became dark brown, signifying the synthesis of biogenic AgNPs. The dark solution of AgNPs was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min after the reaction to separate the pellet from the supernatant. Pellets were retrieved, and supernatants were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min to collect AgNPs. AgNPs covered in freeze-dried CA bark extract powder were kept until they had been physiochemically evaluated and their biological activities were tested. AgNPs' surface shape and sizes were influenced by several physicochemical variables. The factors affecting the shape and size were the driving force behind this investigation. A UV–vis spectrophotometer was used to observe the entire experimental reaction mixture.

Characterization of CA bark extract-capped biogenic AgNPs
Four diffraction peaks at 28.45, 30.98, 32.23, 40.62, and 46.21 corresponding to (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) lattice plans have been used to determine the fcc structure of an Ag metal due to the crystalline nature of the AgNPs (

). The XRD pattern results are verified against the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards database (JCPDS, file no. 87–0720). A possible explanation for the few unclaimed peaks (shown with an asterisk) is that the bioorganic stages that form on the surface of the NPs crystallize (
Philip, 2011
). According to the Debye-Scherrer formula, the average size of AgNPs was calculated to be 7.78 nm. 
Bloukh et al. (2021)
 confirmed the XRD spectrum of L. sativum synthesized AgNPs shows sharp peaks around 2θ = 27.8o (001), 28.4 o (001), 30.9 o (003), 32.2 o (003), and 46.2 o (200). According to earlier research, these broad bands demonstrate amorphous phases linked to the biocomponents of CA leaf extract (
