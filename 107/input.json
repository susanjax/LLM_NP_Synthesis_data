AgNPs were synthesized by varying the concentration of silver nitrate salt (0.50 mM, 0.75 mM, 1 mM and 1.50 mM), temperature (25, 40, 60 and 80 °C), volume of S. aromaticum extract (4, 6, 8 and 10 mL), pH (7, 8, 9 and 10) and reaction times (10, 15, 20 and 25 min), in order to determine the optimum conditions of synthesis of AgNPs. Furthermore, the nature of the SPR (surface plasmon resonance) peak was analyzed by UV–visible spectroscopy. The resulting data were plotted by using Origin 8.5 software. After determining the optimum conditions, AgNPs were synthesized and the solution was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min and washed with distilled water three times. Subsequently, the pellet containing the synthesized AgNPs was dried and carefully stored at room temperature for future applications (Erci et al., 2018).

XRD data was taken for the 2θ range of 30 to 80°. Four distinct peaks were observed at 2θ values of 38.5198, 44.6471, 64.8378 and 77.7537 degrees (as shown in Fig. 3), which were identified as originating from silver metal. The sample's pattern closely resembled the standard silver patterns in JCPDS file No. 04-0783. All the peaks corresponded to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of face-centered-cubic silver in JCPDS file No. 04-0783 (Ali et al., 2023; Syed et al., 2016). No peaks indicating the presence of other phases were detected, confirming the high purity of the products. Similar results were obtained when AgNPs were synthesized using ethanol extract derived from Santalum album fruit (Mehta et al., 2017). The prominent peaks observed in the XRD analysis suggested a significant presence of silver in the sample. These peaks also indicated that the NPs possessed a crystalline structure with a cubic arrangement of atoms at its centre (Jemal et al., 2017). The confirmation of the face centered cubic (FCC) arrangement of NPs was achieved through XRD spectrum analysis using the Scherrer equation. According to different refraction peaks, the size of synthesized AgNPs was calculated and is shown in Table 1. The analysis revealed that the average size of the AgNPs was found to be 19.71 nm.
Structural evaluation of AgNPs was done by TEM. TEM data revealed the size, shape and morphology of the synthesized NPs (Fig. 4a). The data showed that the size of the synthesized NPs was 12.34 ± 1.90 nm (Fig. 4c) and spherical in shape whereas slight agglomeration was found
