Preparation of H. ulmarius extract and AgNPs synthesis
The H. ulmarius extract mushroom extract was prepared as per the modified protocol of Manimaran et al. (2022b); Philips (2009); Bhat et al. (2013); Selvam et al. (2017). About 15 g of fresh H. ulmarius mushroom was repeatedly washed with distilled water. After cleaning, a sterile knife was used to cut the H. ulmarius into small pieces. After thoroughly stirring for around 30 min, the small bits of mushroom were added to the two-litter beaker with 500 mL of double distilled water. The mixture was then filtered using Whatman No.1 filter paper. The H. ulmarius mushroom extract bioactive as a reducing and stabilizing material for the reduction of Ag + to Ag0 was the filtrate. The preparation of 1 mM concentration of AgNO3 using double distilled water has been applied to the H. ulmarius extract and kept at room temperature (37 Â°C) for 60 min. The colour changes of the solution within 30 min, from colourless to reddish brown. However, the solution without AgNO3 is devoid of colour change.
SEM and EDX analysis of Hu-AgNPs
The morphological structure of Hu-AgNPs was noticed by SEM images (Fig. 4a and b) results in the Hu-AgNPs are spherical, polydisperse shape, and range in size from 70 to 97 nm. When the AgNPs were subjected to EDX analysis, strong signals from the silver atoms and signals from the other elements C, O, N, and I were seen. It is evident from the EDX spectrum that Hypsizygus ulmarius-reduced AgNPs have a silver weight percentage of 65.82% (Fig. 4c). This study was supported by an earlier investigation using mushroom-mediated Ag nanoparticles. (Manimaran et al., 2021d; Owaid, 2019a; Mohanta et al., 2018).
The majority of the produced AgNPs were spherical and typically between 20 and 60 nm in size, based on the HR-TEM images (Fig. 5). The results showed that synthesized AgNPs did not aggregate, and the evenness of the particle size. According to Singh et al. (2011); Manimaran et al. (2023b) and Vigneshwaran et al. (2007), noticed the arrangement of rings containing spots in the HR-TEM images of myco-synthesized AgNPs suggested that the nanoparticles are crystalline and have a uniform shape.
