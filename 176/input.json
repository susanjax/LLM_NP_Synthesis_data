Synthesis of NPs@GO nanocomposites
Zinc oxide nanoparticles were synthesis by laser ablation in double distilled water at room temperature. Zinc-target immersed in 1 mL DDW then Pulsed Nd: YAG laser (1064 nm, 1 Hz) was applied with maximum energy 600 mJ and a different number of laser pulses (150, 200, and 250 pulses) to ablate the Zn target and produce ZnO NPs suspend in the solution. The glass container was rotated to get homogenous nanoparticles and prevent etching. The concentration of Nanoparticle in solution increasing as pulse number increased, and it's measured by using this formula: Mass Concentration = ΔM Liquid Volume⁄ (mg ml − 1)
Characterization
X-ray diffraction of ZnONPs samples was measured in 
Fig. 1
, the data was calculated by Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 A The diffraction peaks at angles 2Θ of 31.34°, 37.39°, and 47.51° correspond to the reflection from the (1 0 0), (0 0 2) and (1 0 2) crystal planes of the hexagonal wurtzite zinc oxide structure

. The particles size estimated by using the Scherer equation D = 0.89λ/βCosθ . Where D of the particles size, λ is the wavelength of Cu Kα, β is the full width at the half-maximum (FWHM) by using of the ZnONPs line and θ is the diffraction angle Xpert high score plus program.

 calculated the mean grain size and lattice strain of the ZnO-samples The Williamson-Hall (W-H) measurement used to calculated lattice strain(ε) of the ZnONPs from the Bragg diffraction angle. A Graph between β cosθ against 4sinθ was straight-line that gives information about the strain and the particle size in the form of the slope. The crystal perfects when all atoms are at rest on their correct lattice positions in the crystal structure

. The variation of the lattice strains in samples due to the variation in (hkl) with linear behavior is observed because of the small difference in the average particle size distribution due to the fixing of laser energy
