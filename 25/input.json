Synthesis of nanoparticles.
The nanoparticles (Ag NPs, Ni NPs, and Al2O3 NPs) were purchased from East Nano Chemicals Co. (Iran). All other reagents and chemicals used were of analytical reagent grade.
Characterization of nanoparticles
The Ag NPs, Ni NPs, and Al2O3 NPs were purchased and their characteristics provided by the company (Fig. 6). The UV–vis absorption of Ag, Ni and Al2O3 NPs was 440, 345, and 235 nm, respectively (Fig. 6A). The UV–vis absorption of Ag NPs is mostly known to exhibit a maximum peak within the range of 400–440 nm in which small sphere Ag NPs (10−50 nm) typically have a small absorbance peak at about 440 nm (band gap = 2.25 eV) [41]. According to reported literature, the formation of Ni NPs (10−90 nm) is proven by the presence of an absorbance peak in the region of 320–350 nm (band gap = 3.6 eV) [42]. A strong absorption peak at 238 nm (band gap = 5.25 eV) was reported for Al2O3 NPs (20 nm) [43]. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed diffraction peaks assigned to the crystal planes of (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) for Ag NPs, (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) for Ni NPs, and (1 1 0), (1 1 3), and (2 1 4) for Al2O3 NPs (Fig. 6B).
