Synthesis procedures for the preparation of TiO2 NPs
Synthesis procedures for the preparation of TiO2 NPs used in this work were described elsewhere [24]. The precursor solution was a mixture of 5 cc titanium (IV)-n-butoxide (Ti(OBu)4) and 10 cc isopropyl alcohol. This solution was then added drop wise to a pH 2 solution of HNO3. The hydrolysis was performed at room temperature while stirring for 3 h using magnetic stirrer. After complete hydrolysis of Ti(OBu)4, the solution was refluxed at 70°C for 20 h and a sol was formed. Finally, the formed sol was dried at 60°C for 36 h in a hot air oven to obtain TiO2 powders. The obtained powder samples were calcined for 3 h in a muffle furnace at 400, 600 and 800°C in an air atmosphere and are denoted by S1, S2 and S3 respectively.
Characterization of TiO2 NPs
The XRD patterns of calcined TiO2 samples are shown in Fig. 1. The XRD pattern of the sample calcinated at 400°C (S1) reveals the presence of anatase phase. Rutile peaks started to appear and a mixture of both the anatase and rutile phases of TiO2 existed at 600°C (S2). As calcinations temperature was increased further, a phase transition from anatase to rutile was observed, and the transition to rutile phase is almost completed at 800°C (S3). 
The size of the anatase crystallites (S1) increases from 6 to 25.8 nm when the calcination temperature is raised to 600°C (S2), and increases to 33 nm as temperature is further raised to 800°C (S3, rutile).
Fig. 2 shows SEM images of the samples S1, S2 and S3 respectively. The micrograph shows polycrystalline texture of the material with a large number of interfaces. It shows that all samples have almost spherical shaped grains with some voids are distributed almost uniformly over the entire surface of samples. Moreover, grains of unequal sizes are distributed throughout the samples. Increase of particle size due to calcination is also evident from SEM images of samples.
