Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using S. Ebulus extract (AgNPs@SEE)
The S. ebulus extract capped AgNPs (AgNPs@SEE) was prepared using our previous protocol (
Naghizadeh et al., 2021
) with slight modification. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized by reducing the silver nitrate (AgNO3) with S. ebulus extract. To this end, 12.5 ml of filtrate of S. ebulus extract (the pH of the solution was adjusted to 10–11) was dissolved in deionized water and added to the aqueous solution of AgNO3 (25 ml; 20 mM) under vigorous stirring for 2 h. After 2 h, the light yellow colored mixture changed to dark brown, an evidence for the preparation of silver nanoparticles (Ag+ → Ag0). The reduced mixture was purified by repeated centrifugation for 5 min, and the obtained precipitate was dried in the oven for 24 h. The effect of various physicochemical conditions (temperature, concentration of silver nitrate, and contact time) on the synthesis of AgNPs was studied to obtain the optimum values (
Table 2
).
The size and morphology of the green synthesized silver nanoparticles using S. ebulus extract were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (TESCAN BRNO-Mira3; FE-SEM). The FE-SEM images of the AgNPs@SEE (sample no. 10) were presented in
Fig. 4
. The image obtained by the FE-SEM showed spherical morphology of silver nanoparticles from extract of S. ebulus used as reducing and capping agents. In this study, particles size of the AgNPs was determined 40–60 nm. TEM analysis was used to determine particle size distributions and morphological characteristics of AgNPs@SEE (sample no. 10). Transmission electron microscopy (Zeiss-EM10C-100 KV; TEM) analysis was used to study the grain structure of synthesized silver nanoparticles in detail. The TEM image (
Fig. 5
) showed that the morphology of the synthesized AgNPs@SEE was spherical and oval with particle size about 35–50 nm. The presence of more than one reducing agent in the S. ebulus extract can be one of the reasons for the formation of different size and shape nanoparticles (
Patil and Kim, 2017
). The elemental analysis (EDS) recorded from the biosynthesized AgNPs is shown in
Fig. 6
. The EDS analysis showed an intense silver signal and weak oxygen and carbon peaks. Oxygen (O) and carbon (C) elements are most likely associated with the organic compounds from the S. ebulus extract absorbed on the surface of AgNPs@SEE, which have a crucial role in reducing and capping agents of AgNPs. Similar AgNPs exhibited strong absorption spectra in the range 2.5–4 keV (
Maity et al., 2020
).
The crystalline nature of AgNPs@SEE was further confirmed by X-ray diffraction pattern (Philips X’pert PRO with Cu-Kα irradiation) (
Fig. 7
). The XRD pattern demonstrated the FCC (centered cubic face) crystalline structure of AgNPs@SEE. Four characteristic diffraction peaks were found at 2θ = 38.1°, 44.12°, 64.39°, and 77.11°, which were assigned to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) planes. Additionally, the mean crystallite size of silver nanoparticles was measured using Scherrer's formula (
Oliveira et al., 2019
,
Shirzadi-Ahodashti et al., 2020
): D = 0.9λ/βCosθ (3); where β full width half maximum, λ the wavelength, D is the size, and θ Bragg’s angle. Due to the Scherrer equation, the average particle size of the AgNPs@SEE was about 39 nm. Similar XRD peaks were reported from Urtica dioica (
Jyoti et al., 2016
).
