Synthesis of nano-Ags.
Solid silver (100 g) was dissolved in 100 ml 100 % nitric acid at 90 °C and cooled, and 1 l distilled water was added. By adding sodium chloride to the silver solution, the silver ions were precipitated and then clustered together to form monodispersed nanoparticles in the aqueous medium.

Characterization of nano-Ags.
The size and morphology of the nano-Ags were examined using a transmission electron microscope (H-7600; Hitachi). The results showed that the nano-Ags were spherical in form and had a mean size of 3 nm (data not shown). The final concentration of colloidal silver was 60 000 p.p.m. (ICP Spectrophotometer, Optima 7300DV; PerkinElmer). This solution was diluted and then used to investigate antimicrobial effects.
