Synthesis of ZnO nanostructures
Using the easy coprecipitation approach ZnO nanoflakes were produced for the present work
[41]
. The coprecipitation method was used to produce ZnO nanoflakes with surfactant assistance. Initially, 0.1 M zinc acetate and 0.1 M NaOH were separately dissolved in 100 ml of double distilled water (DDW). Then, the NaOH solution was added gradually to the zinc acetate solution at room temperature under stirring conditions. The precipitated material was filtered and washed with DDW several times. The obtained material was calcinated at 300 °C and labeled as R-1. Similarly, the R-2, R-3 and R-4 materials were prepared using cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a surfactant.

 shows the schematic representation of the ZnO nanoflakes synthesis with the aid of a surfactant.

XRD analysis was utilized to examine the crystals of ZnO nanoflakes for their structural characteristics and purity.
Fig. 2
 depicts the ZnO nanoflakes XRD patterns of varying surfactants. As a result of the coprecipitation approach, the produced sample displayed a weak crystalline characteristic. The associated lattice planes of (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (2 0 0) and (1 1 2), corresponded to the preferred diffraction peaks seen in the samples at 2θ = 31.64°, 34.34°, 36.28°, 47.40°, 56.44°, 62.86°, 67.83° and 69.01° respectively (JCPDS: 00–036-1451)

. These findings confirmed the hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure of the ZnO nanoflakes

[43]
. The intensity of the (1 0 1) increased with surfactant variation particularly in the R-2 sample as compared to others. Using the following Debye–Scherrer equation, the crystallite sizes of ZnO nanoflakes were found between 23 to 37 nm.
