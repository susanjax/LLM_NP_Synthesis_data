2.3. Bio synthesis of Co3O4 NPs
Healthy Arishta leaves is collected and cleaned with double distilled water multiple times and desiccated at flurry of air for 24 h and they were chopped by mixer. The preserved 10 g of chopped leaves is added in to 100 ml of de-ionized water and heated for 120 min. The Arishta leaves extract is filtered using Whatman's No.1 (150 mm) filter paper, and then the pure aqueous extract is collected and it was preserve by standard sanitized way.
As a substitute inorganic reducing agent 50 ml of dark brown aqueous extract of Arishta leaves is gradually added in to 1 M of CoCl2·6H2O solution under continuous magnetic stirring at 900 rpm for 120 min and the temperature was maintain at 100 °C. Then the temperature is increased to 120 °C, then the concentrated solution was condensing and the gel is decomposed by automatic ignition. This degradation is natural redox-reaction method because of the existence of biologically active complexes such as polyphenolic compounds in the Arishta leaves extract. This bioactive compound performs as bio-reducing agent along with stabilizing factor for the bio-mimetic synthesis of Co3O4 NPs. The decomposed progenitors is grinded in to fine fragments using mortar-pestle, and it is subjected to various annealing temperatures (Untreated(RT), 200 °C, 400 °C, 600 °C, and 800 °C) for 2 h.
Characterization 
The archetypal XRD spectra of different annealed green synthesized Co3O4 NPs is depicted in 
Fig. 1
. The high annealed NPs (600 °C and 800 °C) exhibited five crystallographic planes and its Miller indices are tagged with (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), and (440). These peaks can be exploited to the single cubic crystalline phase Co3O4 spinel with lattice parameter in the range of 8.06–8.07 Å and crystallographic space group of Fd3m. The annealing temperature and its duration play an important role for the generation of pure crystalline cubic phase Co3O4 NPs, because the low annealed NPs exhibits high amorphous nature when it compares to the high annealed NPs. The mean crystallite dimensions, lattice parameter, lattice strain and dislocation density of the synthesized Co3O4 NPs is computed through the following equations:
The un-annealed NPs has mean crystallite size of 39.94 nm, but the estimated crystallite size of the bio synthesized Co3O4 NPs increased from 40.56 nm- 53.56 nm with the rising annealing temperature. These results affirm that the generation of pure crystalline Co3O4 NPs rapidly increases with rising the annealing temperature and the maximal value of crystallite dimension is 53.56 nm at high annealing temperature of 800 °C. Moreover, the attained structural parameters of distinct annealed bio synthesized Co3O4 NPs is listed in 
Table 1
. The change in strain energy and dislocation density induces refining in Co3O4 NPs owing to crystal deformation and rearrangement of Co3O4 crystal structure because of increasing the annealing temperature.
