Green synthesis of Ag nanoparticles
A predetermined volume of the Murcott Mandarin peel extract was mixed with a solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3) in a controlled environment. The reduction of silver ions to Ag nanoparticles was facilitated by the bioactive compounds present in the peel extract, acting as both reducing and stabilizing agents. The reaction mixture was stirred at a specified temperature for an optimized duration to ensure complete nanoparticle formation. The synthesis of silver oxide (Ag) nanoparticles involves the reduction of silver ions using bioactive compounds extracted from the Murcott Mandarin peel. Various characterization techniques, including UV–Vis spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD), have been employed to confirm the successful formation, structure, and morphology of Ag nanoparticles. Fruit peel extract Murcott Mandarin peel was used as a reducing agent for the development of silver nanoparticles. Properly washed 50 g of fresh peels of the fruit were added in 250 mL ultrapure water in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask and boiled for 10–15 min. Whatman filter paper (No. 40) was used for the filtration of boiled material to prepare the aqueous fruit peel extract, which was used as such for metal nanoparticle synthesis. Aqueous solution (1 mM) of silver nitrate was prepared and 50 mL of the metal ion solution was reduced using 1.8 mL of FPE at room temperature for 5 min

. Below this FPE Murcott Mandarin peel quantity, the solution takes more than 10 min to get a significant Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) for both the metal nanoparticles. As a result, the brown-yellow solution was formed, indicating the formation of silver nanoparticles.

The SEM image provides insights into the alterations in the surface morphology and microstructure of the CPP material following the treatment process. By comparing the SEM images before and after treatment, researchers can evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment method in inducing morphological changes and modifying the surface characteristics of the citrus peel powder. SEM analysis allows for the assessment of changes in particle size distribution and aggregation patterns in the treated CPP material. Observations from the SEM image enable researchers to determine whether the treatment process has influenced the particle size, shape, or uniformity within the sample. Changes in particle size distribution may indicate alterations in the physical properties and reactivity of the CPP material post-treatment

. The SEM image reveals any modifications in the surface texture, roughness, and porosity of the CPP material induced by the treatment process. Features such as surface irregularities, cracks, pores, or surface coatings can be visualized and analyzed to understand how the treatment method has affected the internal structure and surface properties of the citrus peel powder. Changes in surface texture and porosity may influence the material's adsorption capacity, catalytic activity, or mechanical properties. SEM analysis allows for the assessment of sample homogeneity and the presence of any contaminants or impurities in the treated CPP material. Researchers can examine the SEM image for uniformity in particle size and distribution across the sample surface, as well as any residual contaminants or debris resulting from the treatment process. Evaluating the purity and quality of the treated CPP material is essential for ensuring its suitability for intended applications. The SEM image of the treated CPP material serves as a basis for comparison with the untreated material, enabling researchers to identify and quantify the morphological changes induced by the treatment process. By comparing SEM images before and after treatment, researchers can assess the efficacy of the treatment method and optimize process parameters to achieve desired modifications in the material's morphology and properties. Understanding the morphological changes in CPP material after treatment is crucial for tailoring its properties and enhancing its performance in various applications

 offers valuable information about the morphological changes and surface characteristics of Citrus Peel Powder (CPP) material following a treatment process. The SEM image serves as a visual tool for characterizing the effects of treatment methods on the microstructure and properties of the citrus peel-derived biomass, facilitating further research on its application in diverse fields. Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) in the size range of 1–10 nm can significantly affect the efficiency of lead (Pb) removal from contaminated sources such as water. The efficiency of Ag-NPs in adsorbing lead largely depends on their size due to several factors including surface area, reactivity, and interaction with lead ions. Using silver nanoparticles in the size range of 1–10 nm can potentially improve the efficiency of lead removal due to their increased surface area and enhanced reactivity. However, careful attention must be paid to their synthesis, stabilization, and deployment to maximize their benefits while minimizing potential risks.
