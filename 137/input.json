Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from the root extract of P. integrifolia
The plant was identified, and the voucher specimen (BSI/CRC/2016–17) was submitted to the Botanical Survey of India (BSI), Allahabad, UP, India for future reference.

The roots of P. integrifolia were thoroughly washed under running tap water followed by distilled water. Roots (25 g) were boiled in 100 mL distilled water for 30 min at 60 °C and filtered after cooling. The filtrate was maintained at 4 °C in the refrigerator. The PE-AgNP synthesis was standardized using different concentrations of plant extract (0.8–12%), and silver nitrate (1–5 mM), at different pH (3–9), under varying lengths of sunlight exposure (5–20 min).

Initially, the optimum concentration of inoculum (plant extract) and silver nitrate was optimized. For this constant concentration of inoculum was added in different concentrations of silver nitrate. Similarly, a constant concentration of silver nitrate was added to different concentrations of inoculum. In both conditions, the reaction mixture was exposed to different periods of sunlight (5–20 min). To see the effect of pH on PE-AgNPs synthesis, a reaction mixture containing 6% inoculum, and 2 mM silver nitrate at variable pH (3–9) was exposed for 20 min under bright sunlight.

Characterization of PE-AgNPs
The colloidal stability of PE-AgNPs revealed that particle size, PDI, and ZP were 45 ± 1.26 nm, 0.141, and 27 ± 2.14 mV, respectively (Table 1, Fig. 1C). The zeta potential of PE-AgNPs higher than 25 mV was reported to be stable. The PDI value (0.141) of PE-AgNPs reveals its polydisperse distribution because it is in the range of 0.1–0.4. PDI represents the homogeneity and size distribution as well as the stability of synthesized nanoparticles. A high PDI range reveals larger particle diameters, whereas a low PDI range reveals synthesized nanoparticles with uniform diameter, shape, and size. The PDI value indicates that PE-AgNPs were extremely low polydisperse and moderately dispersed in distribution. Similar results were reported for Diospyros discolor aqueous extract-mediated silver nanoparticles [37].

The HR-TEM analysis was used to determine the exact shape and size of the PE-AgNPs. The HR-TEM images of PE-AgNPs (Fig. 3A and B) revealed the presence of spherical and highly stabilized nanoparticles. The SAED pattern (Fig. 3C) of PE-AgNPs reveals the crystalline nature of PE-AgNPs. A size distribution histogram of PE-AgNPs in the HR-TEM image shows that the majority of PE-AgNPs were present in the 1 nm–55 nm range, with an average size of 30 nm (Fig. 3D). The EDX detector attached to an FE-TEM validated the elemental composition of AgNPs. The EDX spectra (Fig. 3E) revealed a strong silver (Ag) spectral signal at 3 keV, corresponding to the absorption spectrum of AgNPs SPR. Similarly, there were distinct spectrum signals for nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen, which corresponded to the biological macromolecules such as carbohydrates, proteins, etc. present in the plant extract [38].

The dried powder of PE-AgNPs was subjected to XRD analysis. The data were taken in the angular range 20° 2° 80°, with diffraction peaks of 38.09°, 44.04°, 64.26°, and 77.26° for both spectra detected at 2θ (Fig. 4). These peaks were found to be quite similar to AgNPs diffraction data (JCPDS file no.040783). These correspond to Bragg's reflections (111), (200), (220), and (311), respectively. The crystalline planes of the metallic silver correspond to these reflections. The average particle size of PE-AgNPs was calculated by the Debye-Scherer equation. PE-AgNPs were found to have an average size of 32.28 nm (Table S1). The size of nanoparticles determined by HR-TEM analysis was near this value also. The surface roughness and particle size distribution of biosynthesized PE-AgNPs were calculated by the AFM technique. Fig. 5A and B depict the 2D and 3D topographical views of PE-AgNPs, respectively. The maximum height and depth were 18.79 nm and 13.11 nm, respectively (Fig. 5C), whereas the average roughness of the height was 4.84 nm.
