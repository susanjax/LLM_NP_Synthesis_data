 Myco-synthesis of CuONPs from Pleurotus citrinopileatus extract
The protocol for myco-synthesis of CuONPs from P. citrinipileatus extract has been carried out as per our previous investigation with slight modifications (
Sathiyavimal et al., 2021
; 
Dhanam et al., 2023
). Dropwise additions of 50 mL of P. citrinopileatus aqueous extract were made to 100 mL of 0.2 M CuSO4 (copper sulfate) solution, which was vigorously agitated by magnetic stirrer continuously for 3–4 h at 70 °C. The CuONP synthesis was confirmed based on the reaction mixture solution has changed the colour to a brownish-black precipitate. The solid precipitate was washed with deionised water three times followed by ethanol wash for CuONPs separation and dried at 60 °C for 4 h and stored for 4 °C further use.

Characterization techniques
The identification of the phases and topographical structure of the synthesized CuONPs was carried out by SEM analysis resulted

 (a–f), and the size range varied from 60 to 70 nm. 
The particle size and surface morphology of P. citrinopileatus mediated CuONPs were analysed by using HR-TEM and the result showed CuONPs polydispersed and spherical shape. The crystalline nature of CuONPs was confirmed by the SAED pattern. SAED patterns demonstrate that CuONPs exhibited unique lattice fringes corresponding to the typical CuO crystal structure with good crystalline quality (

). 
Malaikozhundan et al. (2016)
 and 
Govarthanan et al. (2020)
 found that the myco-produced CuONPs having secondary surface elements in the mushroom extract and may operate as a potent reductant of CuO salts to CuONPs. Myco-molecules serve as an effective capping agent and stop CuONP aggregation. CuONP SAED and HR-TEM study findings perfectly agreed with the XRD pattern of myco-synthesized CuONPs. The current study was supported by the investigation of 
Chand et al. (2021)
 noticed the FCC structure of CuO using the HR-TEM and SAED patterns of CuONPs produced from Nigella sativa extract.
