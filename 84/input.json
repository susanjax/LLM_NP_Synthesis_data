Synthesis of AuNPs by Tris-Assisted Frens Method
One-pot size-controlled synthesis of AuNP was performed by using the modified Frens method as described by Xia et al. [1]. In this citrate-based reduction process, AgNO3 was used as catalyst for rapid seed formation at room temperature, whereas Tris was used as pH buffer of the reactants. Premixed solution containing tri‑sodium citrate, HAuCl4 and AgNO3 were rapidly injected to 47.5 mL of boiling water in a three-necked round bottom flask under reflux and heated at 98.0 ± 1.0 °C under vigorous stirring for 30 min. Solution was cooled to room temperature and stored at 4 °C. The parameters are described in Table 1.

Characterization of AuNPs
In the present study, gold nanoparicles of 38, 46 and 60 nm were synthesized using modified Frens method. UV–vis spectroscopy (Fig. S1 I) of AuNPs showed absorption peaks at 523, 525 and 537 nm for the above mentioned nanoparticle sizes respectively. Further, the size distribution of nanoparticles was confirmed through FESEM and DLS studies (Fig. S1 II and Fig. S2) and the result summarized in Table 2. FESEM images showed the spherical shape of AuNP and the average diameters in aqueous solution were 38 ± 3.1 for 40 nm, 46 ± 2.3 for 48 nm and 60 ± 1.8 for 60 nm of AuNPs (Table 2). The AuNPs maintained spherical shape but slight aggregation after 24 h of incubation in solution was observed by DLS study (Fig. S1 II). DLS showed the average hydrodynamic diameters of nanoparticles in cell free media (Table 2) to be 44 nm for 38 nm, 48 for 46 nm and 64 for 60 nm of AuNPs.
 Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
0.5 mL of nanoparticles was centrifuged, supernatant was removed, and the re-dispersed in Type I water. Hydrodynamic diameters of nanoparticles were investigated using Malvern™ Zetasizer Nano ZS (United Kingdom) equipped 4.0 mW red laser (633 nm) and a detection angle of 173°. Quartz cuvette was used as sample container. For measurement, solvent parameters were dynamic viscosity and refractive index of water, i.e. 0.89 cP and 1.330 respectively.
