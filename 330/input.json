Preparation of Co3O4 nanoparticles
Co3O4 nano particles were synthesized via thermal decomposition method with slight modification [20]. 0.02 mole (5.8 g in 100 mL ethanol) of cobalt chloride solution and 0.10 mole (12.61 g in 50 mL ethanol) of oxalic acid solution were mixed together and stirred for 1 h using magnetic stirrer followed by sonication for 30 min under 0.5 cycle and a wave amplitude of 140 μm using a sonicator (Heilscher UP200S, Germany) at room temperature. After 5 h, the resultant pink color precipitate was separated by filtration and washed with ethanol. The collected product was placed in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 10–12 h. After that, it was kept in a pre-heated muffle furnace at 400 °C for thermal decomposition. After 2 h, product was taken out from the furnace and allowed to cool naturally following which the collected mass was ground using a mortar.

The XRD pattern of the thermally decomposed product is depicted the Fig. 2. The XRD peaks are detected at (2θ) = 18.82° (111), 30.13° (220), 36.51° (311), 38.25° (222), 44.65° (400), 56.12 (422), 59.47° (511) and 65.36° (440) corresponding to the respective crystalline plane of the lattice (JCPDS card file no. 76–1802). In the XRD pattern, the absence of extra peaks due to the unwanted materials indicates the formation of Co3O4 nanoparticles with high purity. All the diffraction peaks in this pattern can be readily indexed to the pristine cubic phase of Co3O4. This indicates the formation of Co3O4.
