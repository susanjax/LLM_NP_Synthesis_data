Synthesis of CuO nanoparticles
In a typical synthesis procedure, Cu(NO3)2⋅3H2O and citric
acid were dissolved in distilled water with a molar ratio of
1:1. The solution was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 100°C.
Stirring continued until gel formation (approximately 1 hour).
Afterwards, the gel was allowed to burn at 200°C. A light
fluffy mass was obtained as a result of combustion, which was
further annealed for 2 hours at varying temperatures, 400°C,
500°C, 600°C, and 700°C, to obtain the highly crystalline
CuO nanoparticles.
Characterization of CuO nanoparticles
Synthesized CuO nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray
diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). Crystallinity, structure, and crystallite size of CuO nanoparticles were determined by XRD
technique using a Rigaku-Miniflex X-ray diffractometer
(Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with Cu-Kα radiations
(λ = 0.15406 nm) in 2θ range from 20° to 80°. TEM analysis
was carried out using a 200 kV JEOL transmission electron
microscope (JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). FTIR spectra of the
samples were obtained using a PerkinElmer FTIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Inc, Waltham, MA).
