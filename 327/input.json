Green synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles
Mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata) peel was collected from mandarin oranges purchased at a local market. They were dried for 3–5 days under direct natural sunlight, and blended into fine powder. 1 g of powder was placed in a glass container with 50 ml of deionized water, kept stirring for 3 h and then transferred to a water bath where mixing continued at 60 ºC for 1 h. Finally, the solution was passed through filter paper and the obtained aqueous mandarin orange extract was stored in a refrigerator. ZnO nanoparticles were produced using the green synthesis method described by Nava et al. (2017). Thus, 2 g of Zn(NO3)2·6 H2O was mixed with 42.5 ml of mandarin extract and stirred for 1 h at 60 ºC on a magnetic hotplate until evaporation and powder formation were complete. A detailed scheme of the particle preparation is shown in Fig. S1.
2.3. Green synthesis of Fe2TiO5 nanoparticles
Lemon (Citrus limon) peel was collected from spent lemons purchased at a local market. Pectin was extracted by boiling finely chopped up peel in water (1 kg peel, 3 l water) for 30 min. The solution was passed through filter paper and the pale-yellow aqueous lemon peel extract was stored in a refrigerator. This extract was used in green synthesis of Fe2TiO5. It replaced other chemicals commonly used in Fe2TiO5 synthesis as surfactants or capping agents (Ramezani et al., 2015, Vasiljevic et al., 2020) and thus this method can be classified as green synthesis (Talebi et al., 2016). The precursors, 4 g Fe(NO3)·9 H2O and 1.4 g Ti(OCH)(CH3)2 were separately dissolved in 20 ml of ethanol. Lemon peel extract (30 ml) was added and the mixture stirred for 30 min on a magnetic hotplate. Afterwards, oxalic acid solution in ethanol was added by continuous stirring until a thick gel formed. The solution pH was around 2. The obtained gel was further heated to 150 °C in an oven where the gel dried and converted into powder form. The obtained powder was ground and then calcined at 750 °C for 3 h in a chamber furnace to obtain Fe2TiO5 nanoparticles. A detailed scheme of the particle preparation is shown in Fig. S2.
