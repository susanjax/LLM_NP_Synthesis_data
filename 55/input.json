Synthesis of ionic liquid: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride – [BMIM]Cl
The ionic liquid 1-n-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride [BMI.Cl] was prepared using previously described report [12]. 151.5 g [1.85 mol, 1 eq] of freshly distilled N-methyl imidazole, 100 mL of acetonitrile and 220 g [2.4 mol, 1.3 eq] of 1-chlorobutane were mixed in three-necked, round-bottomed flask and reflux it to 60 °C for 48 h. The solution was then cooled to room temperature. The volatile material was removed from the resulting yellow solution under reduced pressure. The remaining light-yellow oil was re-dissolved in dry acetonitrile [250 mL] and added dropwise via cannula to a well-stirred solution of 1000 mL of dry ethyl acetate and one seed crystal of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, placed in 2000 mL round-bottomed flask, equipped with a nitrogen inlet adapter and an overhead mechanical stirrer. The imidazolium salt begins to crystallize exothermically almost immediately, and after the addition of the acetonitrile solution was completed, the flask was cooled at −30 °C for 2 h.
Synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles:
In a typical synthesis, 0.4 g TiO2 P25 was added to 5 mL H2O2 taken in Teflon tube. The mixed solution was then gently stirred and then 35 mL H2O was added slowly in to the Teflon tube followed by 2 mL HNO3 and 0.5 g butyl-methyl imidazolium chloride BMI. Cl with constant stirring. Then the whole mixture was subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 130 °C for 2 days. After the reaction was complete, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally. The product obtained from centrifugation was washed several times with water followed by ethanol. The obtained product was mixed with acetonitrile and stirred overnight to remove ILs. The final product obtained from centrifugation was dried in an oven at 80 °C overnight.
Characterization of TiO2 NPs
Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of TiO2 nanoparticles prepared at 130 °C for 2 days. All the diffraction peaks of the product can be indexed to anatase form of TiO2 nanoparticles (JCPDS no. 021–1272), a = b = 3.785 Å, c = 9.513 Å, 141/amd). The average diameter of NPs was found to be 40 nm and was calculated from Debye-Scherrer's equation:
where D is the crystal size and λ is the wavelength of X-ray radiation (1.5418 Å), β is the full width half maximum of diffraction peak and θ is the scattering angle.
The SEM images of the as-prepared sample are shown in Fig. 4. It Shows the TiO2 nanoparticles are almost spherical in shape. The morphology is further confirmed by TEM and is shown in Fig. 5. It shows of TiO2 nanoparticles are almost oval in shape and the average size of the TiO2 nanoparticles are found to be 35 nm.
