Synthesis of WPI-AgNPs
WPI solutions (0.1–2%, w/v) were separately added with NaCl solutions (concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 10, 20, 50, 100 mM, respectively) in a metal jacketed reactor connected to a thermostatically controlled water bath and the temperature varied from room temperature (RT) to 80 °C. After adding 1 mL of AgNO3 solution (0.01–0.2 mol/L), the solutions were incubated at room temperature with a continuous stirring at 300 rpm for 15 min. Subsequently, 1 mL of NaBH4 solution (0.02 mol/L) was introduced to the solution to form WPI-AgNPs. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 0–2.0 h and the acquired products were stored at 4 °C.

Characterization
The favorable reaction conditions for the formation of WPI-AgNPs were subsequently studied, as shown in 
Fig. S1
, the optimal concentrations of WPI and AgNO3 were 0.5% (w/v) and 0.05 mol/L, respectively. At these concentrations, the most favorable reaction time was set as 1 h under room temperature. In general, small average size, and a high absolute value of zeta potential contributed to the stable dispersion of colloidal particles (
Jian et al., 2019
). As shown in 
Fig. 3
A, all the average sizes of the samples of a−g were smaller than that of pure WPI (211.9 ± 8.6 nm), indicating AgNPs can be formed whether Cl− existed or not. However, the addition of 10 mM NaCl realized the formation of AgNPs with the smallest average size of 22.5 ± 5.5 nm, indicating that Cl− indeed can act as a nucleation controller as previous report (
Morones & Frey, 2007
). Zeta potential reflected the stability of colloidal systems. As shown in 
Fig. 3
B, the zeta potential value of WPI solution was −25.83 ± 1.05 mV. When the nanoparticles were formed, the zeta potential values increased. The WPI-AgNPs synthesized in presence of 10 mM NaCl showed the smallest zeta potential value of −24.53 ± 0.40 mV, indicating that the formed WPI-AgNPs at this NaCl concentration were relatively stable.
Furthermore, the morphology of nanoparticles was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in 
Fig. S2A
, pure WPI was spherical. However, this spherical shape was disturbed when the AgNPs formed. In the absence of NaCl, the number of the formed spherical AgNPs was small and the nanoparticles were connected by a thin layer of WPI (
Fig. 4
A). It was reported that AgNPs might disturb the weak interactions (hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interaction) and unfold proteins (
Al-Thabaiti et al., 2017
). Thus, the shape change of WPI from sphere to such a thin layer is probably attributed to the unfolding of WPI. In the presence of 10 mM of NaCl, the number of the formed spherical AgNPs was drastically increased but with slight aggregation (
Fig. 4
B). Due to the relatively large surface-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles, tremendous protein molecules were adsorbed on their surface (
Pederzoli et al., 2017
), forming WPI coatings that capped AgNPs (
