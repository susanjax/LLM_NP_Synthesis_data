Synthesis of CuO NPs
The one pot green synthesis of CuO NPs was performed as per the procedure available in literature [23, 24] briefly, to 50 mL of 5 mM copper sulfate solution, 5 mL of extract was added and pH was adjusted to 7 using 1 N sodium hydroxide solution. The color changed to green color and the solution was centrifuged and pellet was dried in air oven at 60 °C for 24 h. A dark brown/black color powder was obtained and was stored in room temperature for further study.
Characterization of CuO NPs
The micrograph observed in SEM analysis of synthesized CuO NPs is shown in 
Fig. 3
. The SEM micrograph shows agglomerations of the NPs and the shape of the NPs was observed to be circular with rough surface morphology and dispersed as clusters. The size of the obtained CuO NPs was in 10–60 nm size range.
The crystalline nature and phase orientation of the synthesized CuO NPs was determined using XRD studies. The XRD pattern shows the peaks position with 2θ values of 35.25°, 38.31°, 48.09°, 52.43°, 56.51°, 60.79°, 65°, 47°, and 73.91° (
Fig. 6
) are indexed as (002), (111), (202), (020), (202), (113), (311), and (113) planes. From the XRD spectra, the interplanar spacing and lattice parameter values were calculated and was found to be 0.2269 nm and 0.3983 nm respectively which are in correlation with the standard International Center of Diffraction Data card (JCPDS-45-0937) for CuO NPs confirms that the formed NPs are in crystalline nature with an average particle size of 34 nm.
