2.2. Synthesis of NiO and Co doped NiO NPs using Murraya koenigii leaves extract
To synthesis NiO NPs, 0.1 M of Ni (NO3)2.6H2O was added into known concentration of CLE solution. The CLE metal Ni solution was heated at 80 °C for 6 h using a reflux condenser to avoid solvent evaporation. After 6 h, both the solutions were brought back to room temperature, evaporated at 120 °C to remove the moisture, and sintered 5 h at 800 °C. Similarly, the Co-doped NiO NPs, (0.001 and 0.003 M) of Co(NO3)3 and (0.099 and 0.097 M) of Ni (NO3)2.6H2O salts were dissolved in the CLE solution. Similar protocol was followed for synthesis of Co doped NiO NPs.
Characterization
Fig. 1 (I) depict the XRD pattern of NiO and cobalt doped NiO NPs. The presence of peaks at 2 theta values 37.31°, 43.23°, 62.7°, 75.4°, 79.35° are corresponds to miller indices of (111), (200), (220), (311), (222) indicates the formation of NiO with free from impurities. The obtained XRD data are matched with JCPDS No. 04–0835, which confirmed the NiO nanostructure [41]. The XRD patterns indicates the NiO and Co doped NiO were formed as single crystalline phase with cubic structure. Further no impurities phase was detected in all the three samples. Fig. 1 (I) depicts the enlarged version of NiO and Co doped NiO nanoparticles. The XRD peak intensity reduced as increasing the Co2+ concentration. The reduced peak intensity due to incorporation of Co2+ in NiO lattice which increases micro strain and disorder in the structural crystallinity. Debye Scherrer's formula (Eq - 1) was used to calculate average crystallite size of as synthesised materials.
(1)D = 0.9λ/βcosθ
Where, β – full width half maxima at 2 theta, λ – wavelength. The crystallite size of the materials was found to be 34 nm, 29 nm, 27 nm for NiO, 0.001 M% Co doped NiO and 0.003 M% Co doped NiO respectively. The crystallite size of undoped nickel oxide was decreased as increasing Co2+ dopant concentration. The reduced crystallite size is due to limitation of seed lattice growth on Co2+ incorporation in NiO NPs [42].
Fig. 5 shows the size and morphology of green synthesised Nickel oxide and cobalt doped nickel oxide nanoparticles. Undoped NiO particles (Fig. 5a) are in nanoscale ranging from 80 nm–158 nm. The particles are distributed randomLy with less aggregation. In the case of cobalt doped NiO nanoparticles (Fig. 5b and c), the particles are found to be non-uniform with least aggregation. Further, roughly spherical and size of the particles are found to be 80 nm–250 nm. This random orientation is due the site selection of dopant ions on the surface of host materials. The literature has reported the particle size of pure and Co doped NiO is 21 and 25, 12 and 11, 18 to 43, through microwave assisted synthesis [48], simple chemical method [49], co precipitation method [50] respectively.
