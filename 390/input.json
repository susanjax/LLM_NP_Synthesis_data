Preparation of AgNPs with aqueous leaf extract of S. obvallata
AgNPs were prepared with the aqueous leaf extract of S. obvallata (Fig. A.2 in Appendix A). In a typical procedure, 10 mL of the 1-g/L aqueous extract of the S. obvallata leaf powder was added to 100 mL of the 5-mmol/L AgNO3 aqueous solution in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask. Then the reaction mixture was stirred in a water bath for 60 min at 90°C. The pH value of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 10 with 0.100 mol/L of NaOH and 0.033 mol/L of H3PO4. The color of the reaction mixture turned to reddish brown, indicating the formation of AgNPs. The formed mixture solution was centrifuged, thoroughly washed with water and followed by ethanol, and finally dried in an oven overnight. The same procedure was adopted for the synthesis of AgNPs at different AgNO3 concentrations, plant extract concentrations, pH values, and temperatures.
The crystalline nature of AgNPs was confirmed by powder XRD. The XRD pattern of AgNPs synthesized with the aqueous leaf extract of S. obvallata is shown in Fig. A.4(a) in Appendix A. Bragg reflection peaks were observed at 2θ (θ is the diffraction angle) values of 38.49°, 44.62°, 64.85°, and 77.68°, corresponding to (111), (200), (220), and (311) lattice planes of the face centered cubic structure of AgNPs, respectively. The intense reflection of the (111) plane in contrast to other planes might specify the growth direction of the nanocrystals. Moreover, with the Debye–Scherrer formula (Eq. (1)), the crystallite size of the synthesized AgNPs was calculated to be 16 nm, which was fitted to the Joint Committee Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) Card No. 04-0783 (Sheny et al., 2011).
The surface morphology of the synthesized AgNPs was investigated via the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE–SEM) and TEM. The representative FE–SEM images of AgNPs synthesized with the aqueous leaf extract of S. obvallata are shown in Fig. A.4(c) and (d) in Appendix A. The FE–SEM results clearly showed the spherical shape of AgNPs. The scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDX) results (Fig. A.4(b) in Appendix A) revealed the presence of elemental silver (Ag) and confirmed the successful formation of AgNPs.
The TEM images of AgNPs synthesized with the aqueous leaf extract of S. obvallata are shown in Fig. 3(a). The TEM results revealed that AgNPs were in a spherical morphology with an average particle size of 17.0 nm. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3(b)) showed a ring-like diffraction pattern, indicating the polycrystalline nature of AgNPs (Kumar et al., 2016). The particle size distribution (Fig. A.5 in Appendix A) showed that the average particle size was 17.7 nm.
