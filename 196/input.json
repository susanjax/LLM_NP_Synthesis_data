Preparation of A.panniculata leaves extract and AgNPs
A 10 mg of A. panniculata leaves were weighed and dissolved in 100 ml distilled water, boiled for 30 min and filtered. AgNPs prepared by mixing, 90 ml of 1 mM AgNO3 (16 mg of AgNO3/100 ml DM water) with 10 ml of plant extract and centrifuged for 30 min.
The morphology of the silver nano particles coated fabrics has been examined with SEM and it is revealed that nano silver particles distribution is partly uniform and they are clustered while adhering to the fabric, as can be seen under SEM. Further, it is revealed that nano silver particles within the diameter of 100 nm. The cross-linking of acrylic binder contributes to chemical binding, may lead to entrapping AgNPs. The mechanism depends upon both cross-linking and impregnation (see

 shows the XRD studyof AgNPs. The three peaks observed at 38.24°, 44.52° and 64.8° due to the diffraction (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) planes of face-centered cubic (fcc) silver. By using Debye–Scherrer’s equation it is found that the average size of silver nano particle is around 14 nm.
