Silica core synthesis To synthesize silica (SiO2) core nanoparticles, the sol–gel (Stöber) method of hydrolysis and condensation of TEOS was used, yielding monodispersed silica nanoparticles with a diameter of 25 nm. In a 100 ml glass beaker with a magnetic stir bar, 30 ml of ethanol, 6 ml of DI water, and 1.8 ml of 20% v/v NH4OH were added. The mixture was stirred with an even vortex and 1.125 ml of TEOS was added to the mixture. The mixture was left to stir at room temperature (22 °C) overnight (minimum of 12 h). The SiO2 cores were centrifuged at 9000 RCF for 30 min at room temperature to settle the SiO2 nanoparticles in the pellet and separate the supernatant. The nanoparticle-containing pellet was washed with 10 ml ethanol, sonicated (pulse for 20 s at 40% amplitude), and rinsed with 30 ml ethanol by centrifugation twice.
Our research group has confirmed that the structure of our synthesized nanoparticles resembles naturally occurring bacteriophages, with smaller-sized nanoparticles displaying closer mimicry with bacteriophages.40 The nanoparticles mimic bacteriophages from the family of Microviridae with 88% similarity. Microviridae are tailless bacteriophages, sized 25–27 nm. To visualize the PhaNPs, TEM analysis was carried out (Fig. 2A and B), revealing that the diameter of SiO2 nanoparticle core was 20.5 nm ± 2.1 nm (Fig. 2A). Analysis of PhaNP@Syn71 showed a nanoparticle diameter of 20.2 ± 2.4 nm (Fig. 2B), verifying that further synthesis processes (addition of gold nanospheres, silver, and Syn71 peptide) do not alter the base diameter of the nanoparticle silica core. In addition, TEM image analysis of PhaNPs and PhaNP@Syn71 demonstrated the presence of gold NPs on the silica core. EDXS compositional analysis of the PhaNPs (Fig. 2C) revealed the presence of Si, Au and Ag, in agreement with the synthesis process, with ICP-OES measurements (ESI A Table S1†) further confirming the presence of Au on SiO2AuNPs, and Au and Ag on PhaNPs. The concentration of Si was 3.829 mg ml−1 and 12.068 mg ml−1 for SiO2AuNPs and PhaNPs, respectively. The concentration of Au on SiO2AuNPs was 0.124 mg ml−1, while the Au and Ag concentrations of PhaNPs were 0.054 mg ml−1 and 3.924 mg ml−1, respectively. This is consistent with the synthesis process, showing similar gold content of SiO2AuNPs and PhaNPs, with the addition of Ag on PhaNPs.
Gold nanosphere synthesis Gold nanospheres with a diameter of 5 nm were synthesized using a modified procedure of alkaline reduction.42 Into a 250 ml beaker 43.16 ml DI water, 427 μl NaOH (1 M), 3.21 ml sodium citrate (68 mM), and 1.07 ml THPC (85 mM) were added. The solution was stirred with a smooth vortex for at least 10 min at room temperature, and then 2.14 ml of gold chloride (25 mM) was added. The solution was stirred agitation free at room temperature overnight in the dark.
