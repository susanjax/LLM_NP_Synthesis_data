Synthesis of nanoparticles
Chemicals such as cupric acetate [Cu(CH3COO)2] and nickel nitrate hydrate [H2N2NiO7] were used as sources, and A. marmelos fruit juice was used as fuel for synthesizing copper and nickel oxide nanoparticles by the solution combustion method. A mixture of 1 g cupric acetate, 1.45 g nickel nitrate hydrate, and 2.0 ml, 4.0 ml, 6.0 ml of fruit extract and 3.0 ml of H2O was transferred to individual 50 ml silica crucibles. Four different aliquots were named as CuO-NiO-2, CuO-NiO-4, CuO-NiO-6, and CuO-Ni-0, respectively (Fig. 2). The resulting solution was initially heated on an electric burner to get a semi-solid material, which was then placed inside a 500 °C preheated muffle furnace for 10 min. The obtained material was then subjected to calcination at 400 °C for 4 h to remove interference.
The exterior morphology of the synthesized CuO-NiO Nps was examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The SEM images clearly show that the nanoparticles are agglomerated (Fig. 4). The energy dispersive X-ray spectrum revealed that the CuO-NiO nanoparticles contain 57.93%, 23.49%, and 18.59% oxygen, nickel, and copper, respectively. Although a green extract was used for synthesis, the presence of other elements was absent. This may be due to the effect of calcination of the synthesized materials for 4 h at 400 °C. The appearance of these figures provides information about the morphology of the Nps. The images seem to be a heterogeneous mixture, and the particle sizes vary due to the aggregation of Nps. The surface of the particles is not clean, which may be due to their interaction with the extract. However, considering the SEM results, the expected size range of nanoparticles is from 50 nm to 100 nm. In view of the fact that it is obtained from a sophisticated segment, the 2D stage portion through an unspecified pattern is highly valuable. Elemental maps are especially useful for illustrating the distribution of stable elements in detail, particularly for demonstrating compositional zonation (Fig. 5).
