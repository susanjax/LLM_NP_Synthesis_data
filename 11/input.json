Synthesis of CuO and ZnO-NPs
Cu (NO3)2·2.5H2O, LiOH and NaOH (Merck, ACS reagent, ≥ 98%) were used as starting reagents for the preparation of CuO-NPs. The reagents were weighed in the appropriate amounts and deposited in a YSZ mortar (Yttria Stabilized Zirconia) along with the grinding medium (YSZ balls of 12.7 mm in diameter), to be subsequently deposited in a SPEX mill (8000 M) during 45 min (3 cycles of 15 min) at a speed of 1725 rpm. The ratio of reagents/balls used was 1/10. The amount of reagents used were balanced so that there was no Cu(NO3)2, LiOH or NaOH excess (1:2 M ratio) according to the following equation that describes the overall process:
Cu(NO3)2.2.5H2O + 2[LiOH.H2O + NaOH] -> CuO +2[LiNO3 + NaNO3] + xH2O
where x corresponds to the number of moles of H2O and the molar ratio of LiOH/NaOH is equal to 0.54/0.46.
The milled precursor was transferred to a Teflon box and subjected to a drying process at 80 °C overnight. Subsequently, several washes were carried out using deionized water and ethanol to remove the soluble nitrates, whereas the water-insoluble NPs were recovered by centrifugation and dried for 2 h at 80 °C.
The synthesis of ZnO-NPs was previously reported by Mendoza-Mendoza et al. (2018) following a similar one-step procedure [22].

Characterization of the Nanoparticles.
The milled precursor and CuO-NPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer operated at 35 kV and 25 mA with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.541 Å). The morphology and size of CuO and ZnO-NPs were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in a FEI TITAN 80–300 kV microscope. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) techniques were used to observe structural characteristics of the as-synthesized NPs. 
Fig. 1 (a) shows the XRD pattern obtained after milling the initial reagents mixture for the preparation of CuO-NPs. The characteristic reflections of NaNO3 (JCPDS 85–0850) and CuO (JCPDS 80–1268) crystalline phases were identified, whose standards reported in the ICDD have been included in the bottom of Fig. 1 to facilitate comparison.
Table 1 shows the data of cell volume, crystallite size (CS) and average characteristic dimensions of the particles obtained for commercial and as-synthesized CuO and ZnO-NPs. The CS determined by the Halder-Wagner method reported values of 29.8 and 58.1 nm for commercial particles of CuO and ZnO, respectively, whereas, 14.5 and 10.7 nm were the sizes obtained for the CuO and ZnO-NPs, correspondingly.
Fig. 3 (a) shows a TEM image of the CuO-NPs. It can be observed that the particles showed rod shapes and heterogeneous nanometric sizes. The morphology and size of the particles can be seen in greater detail in Fig. 3 (b), corresponding to the region selected with the blue dashed line in part (a). Fig. 3 (c) presents an image obtained by HRTEM, which reveals the high crystallinity of the synthesized particles that were prepared at room-temperature.
In Fig. 3 (d) it is presented the SAED image obtained for the set of particles contained in the delimited area with the red dashed line in Fig. 3 (a). In this, the main crystalline reflections of the monoclinic structure of CuO were indexed to the (110), (002), (111), (−202), and (−113) planes. Fig. 3 (e) shows the TEM image of ZnO-NPs and it is observed particles with spherical-like shapes and nanometric sizes that are forming agglomerates. Moreover, histograms for CuO and ZnO-NPs obtained by measuring particle size distribution from TEM images are included in Fig. 3. The histograms showed the unimodal distribution for particles of CuO-NPs with main diameter and length of 22 and 6 nm, respectively, whereas 15 nm of diameter for ZnO-NPs. These dimensions are also reported in Table 1.
