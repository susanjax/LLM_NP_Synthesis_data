M. spicata leaves (10 g) were initially sterilized using HgCl2 (0.1%) for 1 min
[20]
. Then, they were boiled (70 °C) in deionized water (100 mL) for 10 min, filtered using Whatman filter paper No.1 and kept at 4 °C for future use.

2.4. Synthesis of CuO NPs using M. spicata leaf extract (Ms-CuO NPs)
M. spicata leaf extract and 1 mM copper sulphate solution (4:1 v/v) was heated (80 °C) under stirring for 25 min until the pH reaches 8.5. The mixture was allowed to settle for 24 h. Then, they were centrifuged (5000 rpm for 5 min) thrice and the buff precipitate were dispersed in deionized water to remove any residue. The precipitate was washed using ethanol and placed in an oven for 2 h at 100 °C.

The phase composition and crystallite structure of the synthesized CuO NPs were determined with the help of X-ray powdered diffraction analysis. A number of diffraction peaks were noticed for Ms-CuO NPs at 32.47, 38.68, 58.25, 67.84 and 68.008°, which corresponds to the (110), (111), (202), (113) and (220) planes of CuO, respectively. The crystallite size of Ms-CuO NPs was 11.28 nm as per the Scherrer formula (
Fig. 2
).
The morphology and size of synthesized CuO NPs were assessed by TEM. Ms-CuO NPs exhibited spherical morphology, agglomerated and have shown a size of 36 nm (
Fig. 4
). EDX analysis of CuO NPs showed the wt% of Cu (91.58) and O (8.42). However, only negligible amounts of other elements from the leaf extract are present (

).
