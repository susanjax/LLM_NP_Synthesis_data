Green synthesis of CPs-mediated CuNPs
Lyophilized CPs as substrate and copper sulfate (CuSO4) (Himedia, India) as precursor were used to synthesize CPs-based CuNPs. The initial concentration of precursor substrate was kept 1:1; i.e., 1 mM CuSO4 was mixed with 1 mM CPs. The synthesis of CuNPs was optimized by varying the concentration to 2:1 (2 mM CuSO4: 1 mM CPs) and 1:2 (1 mM CuSO4: 2 mM CPs). The mixture was incubated at 45°C overnight, and NP formation was detected by observing the color change of the solution. A total of 1 mM CP solution and 1 mM CuSO4 solution were considered respectively as the controls for this experiment

. Further, the colloidal NP suspension was centrifuged (10000 × g, 10 min, 4°C), washed, and lyophilized for further usage.
