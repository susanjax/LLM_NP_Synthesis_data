Preparation of GO
Modified Hummer’s method was used to prepare GO from the graphite flakes. In this method 99 mL of H2SO4 was mixed with 11.0 mL of H3PO4 with volume ratio 9:1 and placed in an ice bath. The reaction mixture was stirred for 10 min at 10 °C. Then 2 g of graphite was added to the previous mixture under constant stirring followed by the slowly addition of 8 g of KMnO4. The obtained reaction mixture was stirred for 6 h until its color changed to dark green. Afterward, reaction mixture was stirred for 10 min after the addition of 6.0 mL of H2O2 to remove excess KMnO4. An extensive care was required for this step because it was an exothermic reaction and released high amount of energy. So, this reaction took place in an ice-cold bath to maintain the temperature. The reaction was cooled down at room temperature. Then slowly added 13.0 mL of HCl in 39.0 mL of deionized with the volume ratio 1:3. Then this mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm. The supernatant was decanted, and the residue was washed with HCl and then with DIW thrice to have its pH around 6 or 7. Finally, the obtained suspension was filtered and then dried in an oven for 24 h at 100 °C. The dried GO powder was black in color.
Preparation of SNC
For the preparation of nanocomposite of SNC, 3.78 g of SnCl2·2H2O, 4.48 g of NiSO4·6H2O and 3.93 g of CuSO4·5H2O were weighed separately. Then these metallic salts were added in the beakers contain 50.0 mL of DIW and 10 mL of methanol separately. Then these mixtures were stirred for 30 min at 50.0 °C. The pH of the solutions was maintained up to 10 by adding 2 M NaOH solution. All the three mixtures were combined together in a separate beaker and then kept on stirring for 3 h at 50 °C. The mixture was filtered with Whatman No. 1 filter paper. It was dried in an oven at 100 °C and then half of the sample was calcined at 450 °C for 2 h in muffle furnace.
Preparation of GO-SNC
For the synthesis of GO-SNC, GO was thermally reduced by sonicating 1.0 g of GO into 100 mL of DIW at 100 °C for 2 h. The rGO solution was poured slowly into the solution of previously prepared metallic nanocomposites and was kept on stirring for 4 h. The mixture was washed with DIW and filtered. The residue was dried in an oven at 100 °C. The resulting product in powdered form was GO-SNC. Half of the quantity of sample was calcined at 450 °C for 2 h.
Characterization
The XRD technique was used to examine the crystalline structure and the chemical composition of the synthesized GO, SNC and GO-SNC. The XRD spectrum given in Fig. 1, exhibits a diffraction peak at 10.78°, which corresponds to the interlayer d-spacing of 8.17 Å, which is almost similar to those reported earlier and this diffraction x-ray correspond to (1 1 1) plane as given in reference card number 01–082-2261. The determined density was found to be 2.12 g/cm3 where the volume of cell was found to be 2834.35 × 106 pm3. It has been evident from the literature, that the peaks for graphite flakes are not appeared in the XRD pattern of GO which suggest that all the graphite was successfully converted into GO.
The XRD pattern of the un-calcined and calcined SNC and GO-SNC are given in the Fig. 2. The pattern for un-calcined nanocomposite beside a sharp signal at 36.55° ascribed to (5 5 1) plane is much noisy suggesting that most the sample is amorphous. However, upon heating, several reflections have been appeared in the diffractogram at 2 θ angle of 23.26, 33.06, 36.55, 42.46, 47.41 and 61.76 due to the miller planes (4 2 2), (4 4 4), (5 5 1), (6 6 0), (6 6 4) and (1200) respectively. All these diffraction bands are matched with reference card no 00–030-0496, confirm the synthesis of Cu, Ni and Sn nanocomposite with chemical formula of Cu9NiSn3 with cubic geometrical shape with space group of F-43 m. The length of all three coordinates of the cubic are of 1.801 nm with 90° of alpha, beta and gamma. The average crystallite size calculated by Debye-Scherrer equation is 14 nm, where 0.75 % imperfection was found in the crystal.
The XRD pattern of the GO/ Cu9NiSn3 nanocomposite (both un-calcined and calcined) are shown in the Fig. 3, which displays the diffraction peak at 2 θ position as that were observed in the XRD spectrum of Cu9NiSn3 nanocomposite as shown in Fig. 3. No shift was seen in the position of diffraction bands is the evidence that the Cu9NiSn3 was only incorporated on graphene oxide sheet and chemical linkage was formed. However, the d-spacing value for the plane (5 5 1) is 2.523 Å in case of pure Cu9NiSn3 nanocomposite whereas this value decreases to 2.458 Å which confirm the incorporation of graphene oxide on the Cu9NiSn3 nanocomposite. This shifting of d-spacing to lower value is because of the reorganization of the lattice position after the mixing of GO and Cu9NiSn3 nanocomposite. As the ionic radii of the Cu2+, Ni2+ and Sn4+ is larger and the space between is larger and after the incorporation of GO, the carbon with small ionic radius adjusted between the metal atoms led the reduction of d-spacing. The average crystallite size increase from 14 nm to 57.45 nm and the lattice strain reduced to 0.59 %, proposed that after the incorporation of GO, the nanocomposite become more stable.

SEM analysis
The SEM image shown in Fig. 4(a) described the morphological features of the synthesized GO, where a layer type structure were detected. The multilayers structure of the GO is observed that has high surface roughness. The cavities/cracks are seen in the GO sheets which might be due to the grinding of the sample after dehydration. The morphological study of the as-synthesized and calcined Cu9NiSn3 nanocomposite was conducted through SEM analysis and the micrographs are shown in Fig. 4(b and c). The snowball-like structures (grains) that are observed in the micrograph (4b) can result from the aggregation of smaller particles, which are formed during the synthesis process.These snowball-like structures are irregular dispersion are clump together, forming larger structures led to the size vibration of the particles. The background of the sample shows high degree of agglomeration, which may be due to high surface energy of the particles which held the particles together. The calcination of sample at high temperature can cause the individual snowball-like structures (grain) in the sample to grow by diffusion-driven processes, such as grain boundary migration and recrystallization. The growth of the individual grains can result in an increase in the average grain size of the sample. The cavities of distinct size are formed due to the irregular arrangement of these grains. The grain size for as-synthesized estimated from the SEM images is ranging from 40.75 to 98.93 nm with average size of 84.55 nm, whereas those for calcined sample ranging from 68 to 123 nm with average size of 101 nm. The SEM analysis was also carried out after the incorporation of metals (Cu, Ni and Sn) in the GO matric to examine the effect on the morphology of the resultant composite. The obtained SEM images are shown in Fig. 4(d and e), reveals that the morphology of the sample is completely changed after mixing of metals and GO. The metal nanocomposite deeply incorporated in GO layer, which have changed the morphology of the sample. The as-synthesized sample shows that the grains are embedded in the GO layer, where majority of the cavities that seen in the Cu9NiSn3 NC (Fig. 4(b)) have been filled due to the deposition of GO. Upon calcination, the GO layer became more prominent and converted to a semi porous sheet and boundaries between copper nickel tin nanocomposite grains are almost disappeared.
