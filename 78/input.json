synthesis of Fe2O3-NPs
synthesis of Fe2O3-NPs according to the following procedure. One mM iron sulfate (FeSO4) was mixed with cell-free filtrate of Purpureocillium lilacinum and incubated at the same previous condition. Following the incubation period, change in color of the solution differentiated the control solution (cell-free filtrate of Purpureocillium lilacinum) from the one containing biosynthesized Fe2O3-NPs. The Fe2O3-NPs was measured by UV–visible spectrophotometer (JENWAY-6305 Spectrophotometer).
Characterization of Fe2O3-NPs
Fe2O3-NPs have been characterized to determine the nano-size and shape. TEM image reveals that the characteristic of mycosynthesized Fe2O3-NPs was hexagonal and their nano-size ranging from 13.13 to 24.93 nm as shown in Fig. 3A. In this study, the average size of the biosynthesized NPs determined by DLS analysis was 176.7 nm and 25% of distribution 101.6 nm (Fig. 3B), which was larger than that determined using both TEM and XRD analyses. This result can be attributed to the capping substances that coat the Fe2O3-NPs surfaces, the fact that DLS analysis is dependent on hydrodynamic particle residues or the homogeneity of the Fe2O3-NPs colloidal solution [59]. The biosynthesized Fe2O3-NPs determined by DLS analysis was with Zeta potential − 41.97 mV (Fig. 3C).
. As seen in Fig. 3D, XRD-based Fe2O3-NPs characterization exhibit eight peaks at 2 θ values 24.7°, 33.5°, 35.7°, 40.6°, 48.9°, 54°, 62.5°, and 64.3° which assigned to planes 220, 311, 202, 400, 422, 511, 440, and 620, respectively for Fe2O3-NPs. The visualized XRD peaks are matched with JCPDS number: 39–1346 of crystallographic Fe2O3-NPs [60]. In line with our clarification of the results, Chatterjee et al. [36] and Fouda et al. [59] reported the successful fabrication of crystallite, monoclinic phase Fe2O3-NPs at the same XRD diffraction planes utilizing metabolites of fungal. The average sizes of crystallite Fe2O3- particles were calculated using Scherrer’s equation. In this context, the average size of Fe2O3- particles was 57.9 nm, output from the analysis of the equation.
