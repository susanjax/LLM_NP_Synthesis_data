Preparation of Leea macrophylla leaf extract
The green LM leaves (Fig. 1) were thoroughly cleansed with distilled water to remove the dust and silt on the leaves. After that, the leaves were minced into little pieces. 160 g of chopped leaves were combined with 1000 mL of distilled water to create the plant extract. This mixture received 10 mL of 1 M NaOH, which was then agitated for an hour at 55 °C. A clear brown color developed after the liquid portion of the plant was collected and repeatedly filtered using Whatman no. 1 filter paper.
Biosynthesis of LM-AgNPs
De-ionized water was used to make a 0.01 M concentration of AgNO3. A 100 mL solution of clear brown extract of LM leaf was combined with 10 mL of 1 M NaOH solution and agitated for 5 min 200 mL AgNO3 solution was added slowly and continuously swirled at 500 rpm. The reaction involved purging inert N2 gas through the reaction vessel which was under airtight condition. The entire process was operated at room temperature (25 °C) and stirring continued for 6 h. The reaction mixture was left to stand in the dark for 12 h. After 12 h the reaction vessel was taken out from the dark room and centrifuged at 9000 rpm using SIGMA Laboratory Centrifuges. The supernatant liquid was drawn off and the sediment redispersed in de-ionized water before being centrifuged for second time. This process was repeated until the supernatant became neutral. Finally, the dispersion of Leea macrophylla leaf extract mediated silver nanoparticles (LM-AgNPs) was collected in a screw cap bottle and stored.
Diffraction beam intensities with their associated atomic positions of silver nanoparticles prepared with LM leaf extract were recorded using X-ray diffractometry. The crystalline nanoparticles of silver could be verified by looking at the plane-indexed peaks of the diffraction pattern in Fig. 6. Peaks occurring at 38.18°, 44.31°, 64.55°, 77.45° and their indices of the satisfied planes (111), (200), (220) and (311) had been ensued, accentuating formation of face-centered Ag [JCPDS number: 04–0783]. Not common among the aforementioned answerable metal nanoparticles' peaks, there also was a crystalline band at 33.22° that suggested more activity of silver ions being broken down to metallic silver, thus encouraging enhanced biomolecular-reduction of the leaf extract. The highest intensity peak resulted when the Bragg diffraction condition was fulfilled by the crystallographic (111) plane. With FWHM of (111) diffraction peak following Scherrer's formula the mean grain size of the as-prepared LM-AgNPs was identified in nano-sized range.
Fig. 7i portrayed Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) of the synthesized LM-AgNPs. The morphology of the LM-AgNPs was determined by FESEM and from the images, the spherical morphology of silver nanoparticles is randomly distributed with average diameter <50 nm. The concentrated nanoparticles interact with the phytochemicals of LM leaf extract contributing to synthesis, causing the particles to agglomerate in layers [48]. Solvent evaporation, while nanoparticle film was preparing for FESEM imaging, generated minor clusters of nanoparticles. Clustering of nanoparticles may also arise due to cross linking between the stabilizing agents; this similar result was discussed by Ref. [49]. Despite of such aggregation individual particles size and shape of LM-AgNPs can be identified from the FESEM images. Almost all particles were spherical or quasi spherical. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images also confirmed the formation of LM leaf extract mediated silver nanoparticles. Particle images with varying degrees of contrast reveal the presence of organic phytochemicals in LM leaf extract [48]. As evident in Fig. 7(ii), a preponderance of spherically embossed silver nanoparticles was characterized by the photographed TEM images occupying many nanoparticles. The amount of time the electron beam was exposed to the specimen and time spent treating the specimen likely provided nanoparticles with a chance to agglomerate [50]. While the sample was being prepared, the slow loss of water pushed the particles closer together, and the formation of aggregates was sped up by the hydrogen bonds that formed between the biomolecules presented as capping agents [50]. However, despite aggregation, some discrete particles smaller than 100 nm are still discernible (pointed by yellow lines). Fig. 7(iii) displays a quite narrow distribution, with most particles falling between 10 and 30 nm in size, while the average diameter of LM-AgNPs was 22 nm.
