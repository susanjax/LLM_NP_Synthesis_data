Green synthesis of PtNPs
Briefly, 10 mL of A. halimus leaves extract was added to 1 mL of platinum chloride solution (H2PtCl6·6H2O) with a molarity of 0.0019 M. Afterwards, to achieve fast synthesis process, the pH of the mixture solution was adjusted at 9.6 (based on preliminary experiments) using NaOH (0.1 M) then the mixture solution was subjected to stirring and heating at 95 °C for almost one hour till a color change was observed from dark yellow to black. The purification step was carried out by centrifugation of A. halimus-PtNPs (At-PtNPs) colloidal solution then collecting the precipitated pellets and washing them using repeatedly with D.W. Then the formed At-PtNPs solution was preserved at 4.0 °C.

The face-centered cubic crystalline structure of At-PtNPs was confirmed by the XRD pattern. Distinct diffraction peaks of PtNPs at 38.1°, 44.6°, 64.7°, and 78.3° corresponding to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) planes were observed (
Fig. 3
). Furthermore, the green synthesized At-PtNPs' preferred growth orientation was the (1 1 1) plane. The obtained results matched the stated requirements for crystalline platinum; JCPDS file no. 04–0802. The Scherrer formula was used to determine the average crystallite size of At-PtNPs, which was found to be about 1.5 nm, which was close to the size range (1–2 nm) observed by HRTEM spectroscopy. The undefined sharp peaks are attributed to the plant residues (
Hosny, 2021
). In addition, the smaller crystallite size reported in this study suggesting the higher proficiency for the synthesized At-PtNPs.

Providing essential information of nanoparticles such as shape and size is usually achieved by using High Resolution Transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (
Hosny, 2021
). It was found that the average particle size of At-PtNPs approximately ranged between 1 and 3 nm as shown in
Fig. 5
 (a-e), similar to other previous works (
Jameel, 2020
,
Tahir, 2017
), which is a very small particle size that could result in outstanding efficiency when these nanoparticles used in various applications. When the hydrodynamic size was measured via zetasizer as previously done by (
Cui, 2021
), it was found to be 9.4 nm. It has to be noticed that the hydrodynamic size is larger than the HRTEM particle size as it includes the size of biomolecules that are capping the nanoparticles (
Dong, 2021
,
Ullah, 2017
). The predominantly observed shape was spherical. The crystalline structure of At-PtNPs was confirmed by utilizing the Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) technique demonstrated in
Fig. 5
f. SAED results were concomitant with the results obtained from XRD analysis indicating the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) planes of crystalline At-PtNPs. In addition, crystalline At-PtNPs consisted of several crystalline lattices with well-defined inter-planer spacing d = 0.21 nm that is shown in (inset)
Fig. 5
e. Furthermore, a histogram size distribution of At-PtNPs that is presented in
Fig. 5
g indicated that approximately 40 % of these particles lie in the size range of 1.5–2 nm. The obtained results were in line with other previous studies (
Jameel et al., 2020
,
Nishanthi et al., 2019
). Furthermore, a comparison between the physical properties of At-PtNPs and other green synthesized PtNPs is presented in
