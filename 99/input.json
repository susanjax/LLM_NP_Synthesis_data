Synthesis and characterization of AgNPs and AuNPs in the presence of CYS and GSH
AgNPs and AuNPs were synthesized by the reduction of silver and gold salts, respectively, using sodium borohydride in the presence of CYS or GSH as stabilizing agents. Several synthetic approaches were tested, where different experimental parameters were employed (concentration and ratio of reactants, ordering of reactants addition, mixing time and speed, etc.) as presented in Tables S1 and S2 given in Supporting Information. All syntheses were performed at room temperature and the mixtures were protected from light. The obtained NPs were carefully characterized by means of size distribution and surface charge employing dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) methods. The visualization of the NPs was performed using TEM. The most stable AuNPs and AgNPs with similar physico-chemical properties were obtained by a procedure in which appropriate amounts of HAuCl4 or AgNO3 were dissolved in ultrapure water (UPW). The biothiol solutions (CYS or GSH) were then added and stirred for 10 min. Finally, NaBH4 was added dropwise under vigorous stirring. The mixture was left to react for 2 h. The molar ratio of [metallic salt]/[reducing agent]/[biothiol] = 1:10:1 was chosen. For AuNPs, the final concentration of reagents was 3 mM HAuCl4, 30 mM NaBH4 and 3 mM biothiol, while 5.6 mM AgNO3, 56 mM NaBH4 and 5.6 mM biothiol were employed for AgNPs. After the synthesis, each of the NP solutions were washed twice with UPW using ultracentrifugation at 15000g for 40 min. The washed NPs were kept in the dark at 4 Â°C.
A detailed characterization of the prepared NPs dispersed in ultrapure water (UPW) revealed a negative surface charge. The observed zeta-potential values (Table 1) were indicative of a high NP stability, as the NPs are generally considered electrostatically stabilized when the absolute values of the zeta potential exceed 30 mV [70]. The size distribution of all NPs was bimodal and the AgNPs were generally smaller than the AuNPs (Table 1). TEM experiments showed a spherical shape for all NPs (Figure 3).
