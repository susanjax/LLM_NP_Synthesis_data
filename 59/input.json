Synthesis of TiO2 Nanoparticles
A solution of Titanium Chloride (1 M, TiCl4) was prepared in 100 ml of Millipore water and the leaf extract was added dropwise under constant stirring (pH~7). The NPs formed during the process were collected by centrifugation (10,000 rpm) and repeatedly washed with ethanol (absolute). The NPs were washed again with distilled water and dried at 100 °C for 7 h for further characterization.
Characterization of TiO2 Nanoparticles
The HR-TEM micrographs of the biosynthesized TiO2-NPs revealed its polydispersed nature. The TiO2-NPs were found to be mostly spherical in shape with an average particle size of ~20 nm as depicted in Fig. 2(a-h). The crystalline nature of the TiO2-NPs was suggested by the bright spots observed in the SAED pattern as shown in Fig. 2(i). In a similar report, Krishnasamyet al., (2015) reported the preparation of smooth, spherical shape TiO2-NPs with size ranging from 15 nm to 45 nm, using A. indica leaf extract [13].
The TiO2-NPs was analyzed using FE-SEM to further examine its size and surface morphology. The SEM images as shown in Fig. 3(a-e) revealed poly-dispersed, spherical shaped TiO2-NPs with size ranging from 20 to 50 nm. Hence, the findings were found to be in consistent with the data obtained from the TEM analysis.
 The XRD analysis was used to determine the crystallinity of the TiO2-NPs. As depicted in Fig. 4(b), the XRD pattern of the biosynthesized TiO2-NPs exhibited seven distinct diffraction peaks. The characteristic diffraction pattern with 2θ values lying at (101), (200) and (215) corresponds to anatase phase of TiO2-NPs while the peaks at (121) and (123) belong to brookite phase. The observed pattern at (221) and (301) corresponding to the rutile phase was confirmed [JCPDS Card no. 21-1272]. Hence, the synthesized TiO2-NPs constituted of a mixture of anatase, brookite and rutile phases.
