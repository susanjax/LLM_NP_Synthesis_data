2.1. Synthesis of urea-coated rod shaped iron oxide nanoparticles
In this study, deionized (DI) water was used for preparation of solutions. In order to preventing from oxidation, solutions deaerated using argon bubbling for 30 min. Iron salts with the mole fraction of Fe3 to Fe2 equal to 2:1 were dissolved in 10 mL DI water containing 1.0 M HCl. The second solution was obtained by dissolution of 23 g urea in 40 mL DI water at room temp. Two mentioned solutions were added together and mixed with vigorous stirring. Thereafter, the reaction flask was placed into the hot oil bath and stirring was continued for 8 h at 90 °C and 1300 rpm. The particle was washed several times with DI water containing 0.01 M HNO3; the particles were, then, disseminated in DI water containing 0.01 M HNO3 and maintained at 6 °C for future use.
Fig. 1 shows the Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy (SEM and TEM) images of nanorods (Fig. 1a and b). Urea coated nanorods were rod-shaped with a length and diameter of 15 and 150 nm, respectively.
