2.4. Synthesis of Fe3O4-NPs
Fe3O4-NPs were prepared by chemical co-precipitation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions in an alkaline solution followed by a treatment under hydrothermal conditions [30]. Briefly, FeSO4·7H2O (2.7 g) and FeCl3 (5.7 g) were dissolved in 10 ml Mili-Q water. Then, these two solutions were thoroughly mixed and added to double volume of 10 M ammonium hydroxide with constant stirring at 28 °C. After that the dark black slurry of Fe3O4 particles was heated to 80 °C in a water bath for 30 min. Ion impurities such as chlorides and sulphates were removed by washing the particles several times with Mili-Q water. The particles were then dispersed in 10 ml Mili-Q water and sonicated for 20 min.

Characterization of iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4-NPs)
Fig. 1 shows that the XRD pattern of Fe3O4-NPs clearly exhibiting the crystalline nature of this material. Based on the comparison of their XRD patterns with the standard pattern of Fe3O4 (JCPDS 75-0033). The diffraction peaks corresponding to (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (5 1 1), and (4 4 0) are quite identical to the characteristic peaks of the Fe3O4 crystal structure. The crystallite size has been estimated from the XRD pattern using the Scherrer's equation [31].
The average crystallite size of Fe3O4-NPs was also found to be 36 nm. Fig. 2A shows the typical TEM image of Fe3O4-NPs. The average diameter was calculated by measuring over 100 particles in random fields of TEM view. The average TEM diameter of Fe3O4-NPs was 22 nm which is supporting the XRD data.
The morphology and size of the Fe3O4-NPs were further validated by AFM analysis. Fig. 2B, shows the AFM image of Fe3O4-NPs obtained on scanning probe microscope in tapping mode, under ambient conditions. The average size of the nanoparticles and surface roughness (Ra) were determined to be 31 and 22 nm, respectively using WSXM and SPIP softwares.
