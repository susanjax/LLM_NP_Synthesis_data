Materials and method
We used only analytical grade chemicals in the experiment, and it didn't require any further purification steps. These chemicals were zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO).2H2O, ethanol, dimethylformamide (DMF), acetone, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and liquid ammonia. M/s CDH chemicals supplied Molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) power. The experiment was performed taking doubled distilled water. ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized using 0.2 M of 99.999% pure Zn(CH3COO)2•2H2O in 10 mL of ethanol at 80 °C. Liquid ammonia (25%) was added to the above and mixed until pH 9 was reached. It was centrifuged after 2 h of sonication, and washed repeatedly with DDW/acetone to eliminate extra NH3 residue. The powder was oven-dried for 8 h at 100 °C. The synthesis of nano MoS2 involved the utilization of commercially obtained MoS2 powder without undergoing any purifying process. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was used as a stabilizing agent while MoS2 powder at a concentration of around 0.1 M was sonicated in 20 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent for five hours. This process was aimed to produce nano-flakes of MoS2. The prepared sample was centrifuged and dried for 2 h at 100 °C. The same procedure was used to dissolve 0.2 gm of 0.1 M ZnO in DMF while stirring continuously. Mixed with this was 0.2 gm of 0.1 M MoS2. The solution was kept at an alkaline pH (∼8.5) by adding 7.5 mL of ammonia (NH3) and stirring it continually. Following this, the reaction was carried out for 8 h by placing the solution in reflux medium at a temperature of 75–85 °C. After collecting the powder, it was cleaned three to five times with acetone before drying. To get rid of any remaining impurities, the powder was extracted and dried again for an hour at 80 °C.

To examine the structural characteristics of the ZnO-MoS2 nanocomposite along with the pristine samples, XRD method was used. The XRD patterns were analyzed and peaks were identified by comparing them to the standard JCPDS of standard ZnO (file no. 36–1451) and MoS2 (file no. 37–1492) in order to investigate the phase and crystal structure of the samples [25,61]. The hexagonal wurtzite structure of zinc oxide is associated with specific peaks that can be detected in the XRD pattern shown in Fig. 1. Space group P63mc is assigned to this structure [23,25]. It was discovered that there were nine distinct peaks in the XRD spectrum, and these peaks were related to the planes of hexagonal ZnO that were (100), (101), (002), (110), (102), (200), (103), (112), and (201). Fig. 1 also includes a representation of the XRD pattern of MoS2 in its purest form. With the use of the standard JCPDS file, the development of eight XRD peaks has been indexed to the crystal planes of hexagonal molybdenum disulfide. These peaks are (004), (100), (101), (103), (105), (106), (110), and (008) [61,62]. If we take a look at the XRD pattern of the nanocomposite (ZnO-MoS2), we will notice that there are multiple diffraction peaks of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO and MoS2 that have developed. As a result of the peaks being indexed, it has been determined that they are associated with the crystal planes of ZnO and MoS2 [25,63]. It has been revealed that the diffraction spectra do not contain any additional impurity-related peaks that have been detected. It was discovered that the pristine ZnO and MoS2 samples have a size of 29 nm and 49 nm, respectively, by applying the Scherrer formula for the purpose of calculating the average grain size of the samples. The nanocomposite sample, on the other hand, undergoes a shift in size to 42 nanometers. ZnO, MoS2, and ZnO-MoS2 are assumed to have lattice microstrain values of 0.0012, 0.0047, and 0.0031 respectively, according to the estimates. Consequently, the strain value of the nanocomposite is lower than that of pure MoS2, but it is higher than that of a sample of pure ZnO.
The examination of the morphology of ZnO-MoS2 sample was performed employing FESEM equipment. The illustrative image of the nanocomposite, as shown in Fig. 2a, portrays the agglomeration of particles. Thick layers of nanosheets and nanoparticles are observed from the image which intends the evolution of MoS2 nanosheets and ZnO nanoparticles. The EDAX spectrum is depicted in Fig. 2b. This spectrum was crucial in determining the elemental composition of the sample. The information regarding the presence of elements such as; Zn, Mo, O, and S in the nanocomposite sample is conveyed through this spectrum. Thus, the above study validates the XRD findings that predicted the formation of a ZnO-MoS2 nanocomposite. The ZnO-MoS2 nanocomposite sample underwent microstructure analysis via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results acquired are illustrated graphically in Fig. 2 (c & d). The transmission electron micrographs provide convincing evidence that there are two distinct categories of particle distribution that are related with ZnO and MoS2 nanocrystals. In contrast to MoS2 nanoparticles, which range in size from 50 to 70 nanometers, zinc oxide nanoparticles are only 30 to 40 nanometers in size. A strong agreement can be shown between the above findings and the conclusions that were reached through the utilization of X-ray diffraction (XRD) investigation.
