Collection of plant materials and preparation of extract
Fresh leaves of Mikania cordata were collected from Rajshahi University campus and 4 gm of leaves were cursed and mixed in 200 mL distilled water. Then the mixture was boiled at 60°C in a bath for 30 minutes and allowed to cool. Thereafter, the extract was filtered using Whatman filter paper and it was further centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 minutes. Finally the supernatant was collected and used as plant extract for synthesis of nanoparticles.
Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
In preliminary screening, silver nitrate of different concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 mM and 1 M) was used for synthesis of nanoparticles and the optimum concentration of silver ion (1M AgNO3) was determined based on maximum UV absorption. Then 6 mL of AgNO3 (1M) was added with 40 mL of extract and 154 mL of deionized water was added to it for preparation of AgNPs. The mixture was shaking very gently and then put into a water bath at 80° C for 70 minutes to optimize the formation of AgNPs. After incubation at 80 °C, reaction mixture was observed reddish brown color. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes (at 4°C) and the supernatant was discarded. Deionized water (5 mL) was added to the precipitate and centrifuged again with the same specifications. The process was repeated several times. The final precipitate was then placed in a hot air oven for 2 hrs at 50°C, and the dried form was utilized in further testing (Naveed et al., 2022). The overall green synthesis of AgNPs from Mikania cordata leaves is shown in Fig. 1.
The XRD pattern shows the crystalline structure of silver nanoparticles synthesized from Mikania cordata leaves (Fig. 4). Five main characteristic diffraction peaks for Ag were observed at 37.9o, 44.1o, 64.3o, and 76.5o which are indexed as (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of face-centered cubic (fcc) Ag, respectively (Card No: 03-065-2871) (Huang et al., 2007). Two other peaks at 2θ = 27.6 and 32.0 (Card No: 00-031-1238) were also observed and these peaks were assigned to reflection planes of AgCl nanoparticles (Card No: 00-031-1238) (Kishanji et al., 2017). In general, the width of XRD peaks is related to crystallite size. Debye-Scherer equation was used to determine average crystallite diameter from half width of the diffraction peaks:
where D is mean crystallite size of the powder, λ is the wavelength of Cukα, β is the full width at half-maximum, θ is the Bragg diffraction angle and k is a constant. The (111) plane was chosen to calculate crystalline size. From Debye-Scherer equation, the average crystallite size of synthesized AgNPs was found to be 34.2 nm (Gaddala & Nataru, 2015; Kouvaris et al., 2012). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of synthesized AgNPs is shown in Fig. 5(a). The SEM image showed individual silver particles as well as a number of aggregates. The SEM image showed relatively spherical-shaped nanoparticles formed with diameter ranging 26.8–46.0 nm. Aggregated molecules were formed in the range of 46 nm, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The SEM image depicted that the size of nanoparticles were below 50 nm. The elemental composition of synthesized AgNPs was investigated and confirmed by EDX spectroscopy. EDX spectrum indicates that synthesized AgNPs contain primarily Ag, C and O as given in Fig. 5(b). Carbon (C) and oxygen (O) atoms were noted and their presence confirmed that the organic contents present in the plant extract were responsible for the reduction and stabilization of AgNPs. Generally silver nanoparticles show specific optical absorption peak in the range 2.5–3.5 keV. Our findings were consistent with previous literature studies (Hemmati et al., 2019; P. Sathishkumar et al., 2016).
