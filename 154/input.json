2.1. Preparation of leaves extraction
The leaves of Luffa acutangula (Family: Cucurbitaceae) were gathered from Nattamangalam Village, Vellore, India, and the gathered plant leaves were approved (PARC/2017/3522) by Professor. P. Jayaraman, Director, Institute of Herbal Botany, Plant Anatomy and Research centre, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. The newly gathered leaves sample was surface cleaned with running faucet water for eliminate soil followed by refined water and shade dried for 7–8 days at room temperature. The dried sample was powdered in a blender and sieved to get uniform size range and put away at 4 °C for additional investigations. From that, 5 g of leaves sample was risen in 100 ml of refined water taken in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask at 60 °C for 15 min. At that point, the concentrate was separated utilizing Whatman No.1 filter paper. The filtrate was utilized for the synthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles.

3.5. TEM-SAED examination
TEM is one of the important amazing assets which gives the structure and size information of the nanoparticles. Consequently, the definite shape and size of TiO2 NPs were done with TEM. The TEM picture of TiO2 NPs states that the nanoparticles were hexagonal in shape, with a size range of about 10 to 49 nm, in which not many nanoparticles were agglomerated (
Fig. 5
d-f). At highest magnification, the TEM micrograph exposed that TiO2 NPs were not in very close physical connection but rather isolated by constant distance with certain divergences. The capping of TiO2 NPs have likewise been seen under TEM micrograph. This capping might be due to the presence of phytochemicals in the extract.
Fig. 5
g displays the SAED pattern for the synthesised TiO2 NPs. The noticed TiO2 NPs were a constant hexagonal in structure with a diameter ranging from 5 to 7 nm. On the other hand, a diffused rings and a brilliant spot in the SAED pattern specify that the nanoparticles were well crystallized in nature.
