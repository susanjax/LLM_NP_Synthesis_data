 Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles by fungal filtrate – AgNP@Fo For the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNP@Fo), the fungus Fusarium oxysporum with the original code: VR-039 was used. The microorganism was collected from the root of Musa sp. from the locality of Vale do Ribeira, in the municipality of Eldorado/São Paulo in Brazil.
The first step was to grow a culture of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum in Petri dishes using a culture medium of 0.5% yeast extract, 2% malt extract, and 2% agar. The inoculated medium was left for 7 days at 28 °C for fungus growth. After 7 days, a 500 mL liquid culture medium was made, consisting of 0.5% yeast extract and 2% malt extract. Approximately 1 cm2 of the solid medium with the fungus was removed and transferred to the sterile liquid medium. The 500 mL culture medium was then incubated in a Shaker under 150 rpm agitation at 28 °C for 6 days. The biomass obtained was filtered using filter paper and washed with deionized water. Approximately 10 g of biomass was weighed and put into 100 mL of deionized water. This material was stirred at 150 rpm at 28 °C for 3 days. Next, the mixture might have taken on a pinkish color. The solution with biomass was then filtered using a Büchner funnel and filter paper (Qualy filter paper 9.0 cm diameter, 80 gm−2 grammage, 205 μmol L−1 thickness, 14 μmol L−1 most pores), and the fungal filtrate (FF) was used for the synthesis of AgNP@Fo. Finally, AgNO3 1 mmol L−1 solution was added, and the reaction mixture was kept at 28 °C under protection from light. The formation of AgNP@Fo was investigated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy in a range of 200 to 800 nm.

2.1.2 Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles by orange peel extract – AgNP@OR The orange extract was obtained by mixing 25 g of orange peel in 400 mL of distilled water. The system was boiled for 2 min. After cooling, solid residues were removed from the extract using a Büchner funnel and filter paper. For the synthesis of the nanoparticles, AgNO3 1 mmol L−1 was used as the silver ion source, followed by shaking in a horizontal shaker for 2 h.
After 96 h of biosynthesis, AgNP@Fo exhibited a medium nanoparticle size of 56.43 ± 19.18 nm, determined using DLS (Fig. 2C), and 20.81 ± 5.08 nm using STEM (Fig. 2G). The main difference between DLS and STEM lies in the approach used to measure the size of nanoparticles. DLS provides information about the average hydrodynamic size of particles in solution, while STEM offers direct images of the size and shape of individual nanoparticles.26,27

The zeta potentials of these nanoparticles, when diluted in Milli-Q water at a 1 : 10 v/v ratio, was measured and negative zeta potential values were attributed to the presence of carboxylate groups in the biological samples, playing a role in the stabilization of AgNPs.26 The zeta potential of AgNP@Fo was −26.8 ± 7.55 mV. This stabilization led to a polydispersion index (PDI) of 0.163, indicating a relatively homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles within the colloid. The concentration of AgNP@Fo was calculated to be 0.401 ± 0.099 mmol L−1 using the calibration curve depicted in Fig. 1, closely aligning with the theoretically expected concentration of 0.5 mmol L−1, thereby falling within the anticipated range, as indicated by Fig. S1 and Table S1.†

On the other hand, AgNP@OR nanoparticles showed smaller average sizes 39.97 ± 19.72 nm, determined using DLS (Fig. 2D), and 11.77 ± 1.90 nm using STEM (Fig. 2H). The zeta potential for these nanoparticles was −26.2 ± 2.87 mV, demonstrating a similar negative charge as observed for the AgNP@Fo. The sample exhibited a PDI value of 0.414, consistent with previous research suggesting that AgNPs synthesized from fruit and vegetable extracts often display moderate PDIs, from 0.3 to 0.5.29 Additionally, the concentration of AgNP@OR was determined to be 0.465 ± 0.01 mmol L−1 (Fig. S1 and Table S1†).
