Nanoparticle synthesis
A salt solution was mixed with peel extracts in a 1:1 ratio separately. Aluminum foil-wrapped mixtures were set into the oven at 60 °C for 24 h. Solid produce was centrifuged at 300 rpm for 5 min, followed by repeated washing with deionized water to clear unreacted salt and biowaste concentrate. The resultant suspensions were centrifuged again, and attained material was dried in an oven at 80 °C for 2 h. A portion of the synthesized particles was calcined at 500 °C for 3 h. These calcined and non-calcined nanoflowers were then used for characterization and application.
