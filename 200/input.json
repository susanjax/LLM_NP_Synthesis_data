Nanoparticle synthesis
A salt solution was mixed with peel extracts in a 1:1 ratio separately. Aluminum foil-wrapped mixtures were set into the oven at 60 °C for 24 h. Solid produce was centrifuged at 300 rpm for 5 min, followed by repeated washing with deionized water to clear unreacted salt and biowaste concentrate. The resultant suspensions were centrifuged again, and attained material was dried in an oven at 80 °C for 2 h. A portion of the synthesized particles was calcined at 500 °C for 3 h. These calcined and non-calcined nanoflowers were then used for characterization and application.
Characterization
SEM image indicated that calcined ZnO nanomaterial fabricated from vegetable peel extracts are magnificent nanoflowers (NFs). Images also revealed clustering of nanoflowers in size range of 30–63 nm (see 
Fig. 2
). Spherical shaped ZnO nanoparticles by using zinc nitrate and Aloe Vera leaf extract 
[28]
, lemon juice and zinc acetate 
[29]
, and zinc nitrate heptahydrate with Cassia fistula extract 
[30]
 are already reported. The EDX data revealed only 2–3% by mass untreated chloride from source salt (ZnCl2) and calcium double to it (5–6%). Calcium release could be from waste extracts 
[31]
. The data show clearly that NFs prepared by the above method was in a quite pure phase.
XRD pattern of the calcined sample gives characteristic peaks at 2θ: 31.72, 34.51, 36.37, 47.65, and 56.63 having planes (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), respectively. These results were matched with the PDF file: 01–079-0207 having a hexagonal wurtzite structure

.

X'pert Highscore PANalytical software was used for this matching. Debye-Scherer's equation was used for the size computation of the synthesized particles. (D = kλ/βcosθ). The greener shade of synthesis by using bio-based materials is very vibrant. Plant-based biomolecules have control over the morphology and nature of NFs. By using the same process for ZnO NFs average particles size of Z1, Z2 and Z3 were estimated as 37.91 nm, 42.37 nm, and 28.6 nm, respectively (see 
Fig. 3
). It portrays that the extract of pea peels was more effective than potato and cauliflower peels for producing smaller NFs. Graph also exhibits the purity of ZnO NFs as no impurity peak is obtained. Sharper peaks depict that crystallinity of ZnO NFs is improved after calcination
