2.2. Synthesis of Ag–Au, Ag-Cu, and Au-Cu BMNPs
In a typical synthesis of Chry@Ag-Au BMNPs was performed by adding 12.5 mL of 0.02 M AgNO3 and 12.5 mL of 0.01 M HAuCl4 in a Falcon tube. Then, the tube was mixed and heated until reaching 60 °C. When the temperature was reached, 2.5 mL of the Chrysin was added to the mixture (2:1:1 proportion), kept at constant stirring, and heated at 80 °C for 1 h. The NPs formation was monitored and confirmed by a change of color from transparent to brown (for silver) or black (for gold). The reaction mixture was cool at room temperature, centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was discharged. The obtained product was solidify and washed with 70 % ethanol, left to dry at room temperature for 24 h, and finally lyophilized (Free Zone 6, Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA) for another 24 h. In a similar way, we have synthesized Chry@Ag-Cu and Chry@Au-Cu BMNPs with their corresponding precursors under identical reaction conditions as mentioned above.

In general, the structure of nanoparticles have much attention due to their interesting catalytic and biological properties, which are mostly dependent on their surface morphology and size. In order to evaluate the surface morphologies of Chry@Ag-Au, Ag-Cu, and Au-Cu BMNPs by using SEM analysis ( Fig. 4 a–c). The obtained SEM images of BMNPs have smooth surface, spherical morphology, and dispersed on the surface of Chry in BMNPs. The three kinds of BMNPs arrays exhibit hexagonal non-closed arrangement with the central distance between the two nearest-neighboring structural units of 500 nm. It indicates that each structural unit has near-spherical shape with uniform size, and the average diameter of Chry@Ag-Au, Ag–Cu and Au–Cu BMNPs was 196 ± 4 nm, 213 ± 5 nm, and 230 ± 8 nm, respectively.
The crystalline nature and structure of the prepared Chry@Ag–Au, Ag-Cu, and Au-Cu BMNPs are further confirmed by using XRD analysis. Fig. 2 shows the XRD spectra of the synthesized Chry@Ag–Au, Ag-Cu, and Au-Cu BMNPs. In all XRD patterns of BMNPs, the strongest peak was observed at 38.26° which corresponds to the predominant growth in the direction of (1 1 1) plane. The (2 0 0) plane can be attributed to the peak at 44.40° and other two reflections were observed at 64.56° and 77.66° are assigned to the (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) planes respectively [26] . All the four diffraction peaks for BMNPs reveal that they are crystallized in fcc structure. In addition, individual metals (Ag, Au and Cu) have very similar lattice constants and hence no lattice constants mismatch is observed for BMNPs and all reflections in the XRD pattern resemble to that of monometallic counterparts. The obtained XRD results were demonstrated that the Chry@Ag–Au, Au–Cu and Ag–Cu BMNPs are FCC structure and have good crystallinity with a strong (1 1 1) crystal plane orientation.
