Green-fabrication of EC-AgNPs and EC-ZnNPs
Purified gum (E. camaldulensis) was used for the biosynthesis of EC-ZnNPs and EC-AgNPs. Precisely, 5.0 g of gum was dissolved in 500 mL of distilled water. Zinc nitrate (0.2 g) and silver nitrate (0.16 g) were separately added to synthesize EC-ZnNPs and EC-AgNPs, respectively. The prepared NPs were purified by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were discarded while the pellets were collected and dried at 40 째C in an incubator and ground to a fine powder [

].

XRD analysis of E. camaldulensis gum samples and the green-fabricated NPs was carried out to determine their amorphous or crystalline nature. The XRD pattern of E. camaldulensis gums (crude and purified) shows a broad peak at 20째, thus revealing the amorphous nature (
Fig. 3
). On the other hand, the prepared EC-ZnNPs and EC-AgNPs exhibited a high and sharp diffraction peak at 25째 and 40째, respectively, indicating a rise in the intensity of diffraction peaks than that to the crude gum sample. The results confirmed a high degree of crystallinity of the developed EC-ZnNPs and EC-AgNPs [

Surface morphologies by scanning electron microscopy
All the prepared samples, i.e. crude, purified, EC-ZnNPs, and EC-AgNPs were subjected to scanning electron microscopy to envisage their surface morphologies (
Fig. 4
). Crude gum of E. camaldulensis (
Fig. 4
A) showed a smooth and flat surface without the presence of any cracks, whereas, the purified E. camaldulensis gum was not flat and smooth in texture (
Fig. 4
B). The SEM of synthesized EC-ZnNPs (
Fig. 4
C) and EC-AgNPs (
Fig. 4
D) reveals the irregular size and shape with the increase of roughness of surface that may be due to the incorporation of nanoparticles. Few agglomerations were also observed in the case of NPs, which might be due to different phenolic compounds of the sample [
75
]. The integration of EC-AgNPs with gum sample is responsible for the change in surface morphology from a smooth surface to the porous and irregular structure [

].
