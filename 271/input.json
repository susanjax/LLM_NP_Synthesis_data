Synthesis of biogenic silver nanoparticles (bAgNPs)
To synthesize biogenic silver nanoparticles (bAgNPs), ethanolic extract of P. emblica flesh was utilized (Fig. 1a). The flesh extract was prepared according to our previously published protocol.12,30–32 Briefly, P. emblica was procured from the local market, Savar, Dhaka-1342, Bangladesh, thoroughly washed with distilled water, sun-dried, and ground to fine powder. Ten grams (10 gm) of the powder was mixed with 100 mL of 70% ethanol and continuously stirred for 72 hours. The resulting mixture was filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper, the solvent was evaporated completely, and stored at 4 °C. The extract was resuspended in MQ water to make 1% suspension prior to mixing with 10 mM AgNO3 in two separate Duran glass bottles at a ratio of 1 : 9 (i.e., 8 mL extract suspension and 72 mL AgNO3). One bottle was left undisturbed while pH of the other bottle was adjusted to 10 using concentrated NaOH solution. Both reaction mixtures were incubated in the dark for 24 h at room temperature with constant stirring to prevent the photoactivation of AgNO3. The phytochemicals present in the extract served as reducing agents and brought about the reduction of Ag+ to Ag0. After incubation, the unconjugated phytoconstituents, and AgNO3 were separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation at 16 873g for an hour. The supernatant was carefully removed to collect the synthesized bAgNPs. Finally, the synthesized bAgNPs were washed twice with distilled water and redispersed using distilled water.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1c) images demonstrate that both the as-synthesized nanoparticles are spherical in shape. The particle size distribution (PSD) graphs of both bAgNPs and bAgNPs@pH were prepared using their respective TEM images. The average size of bAgNPs and bAgNPs@pH were found to be 15.3 nm and 20.1 nm, respectively (Fig. 1c).

The phase, orientation, and crystal size of the bAgNPs in their as-prepared state were determined through powder XRD analysis. Fig. 2b exhibits clear distinction patterns indicative of crystalline silver. These patterns confirmed the presence of face-centered cubic (fcc) crystalline elemental silver, as evidenced by the Braggs peaks at 2θ angles of 34.32, 38.08, and 44.32 degrees which correspond to the Miller indices (122), (111), and (200), respectively, for both the as-synthesized bAgNPs. These results were consistent with the JCPDS database designated file number 04-0783. Furthermore, the crystalline grain size of bAgNPs was also determined using Scherer's equation, where the mean crystalline size of the particle (D) was calculated as D = (Kλ/β cos θ), with a shape factor (K) of 0.9, wavelength of the X-ray radiation (λ) of 0.154 nm, full width at half maximum (FWMH) (β) of (π/180) × FWMH, and Bragg angle (θ). The average size of the particles calculated using Scherer's equation was 15.86 nm and 19.21 nm, respectively. The size of the particles matches closely with the average size of bAgNPs, and bAgNPs@pH obtained from TEM images, that is, 15.3 nm and 20.1 nm, respectively.
