synthesis of AuNPs
For the synthesis of AuNPs, 5 ml of A. comosus extract was added to aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (6 mM) and stirred continuously for 5 min and it was turned to dark ruby red color after 6 h which gives AuNPs (g1). This colloid was found to be stable for about one month showing no precipitation or color change. 
Characterization of AuNPs
The stability of the synthesized AuNPs was studied by measuring its optical spectra of g1 at different time, since it was an important parameter in synthesis of nanoparticles. Fig. 1(i) shows the UV–vis spectra of g1 at different reaction time. The visual inspection of g1 at different reaction time has been also shown in Fig. 1(i) inset. As the effect of reaction time, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) bands of the prepared AuNPs exhibited blue shift (550–546 nm) with increasing absorbance. The blue shifted and narrow SPR band indicating the formation of small spherical nanoparticles with the effect of reaction time was also found in TEM images. 
The diffraction peaks were observed at 38.2°, 44.1°, 64.8° and 77.6° in the 2θ range and they corresponding to (111), (200), (220) and (311) Bragg׳s reflections based on the FCC structure of AuNPs with space group of Fm-3m (JCPDS: 04-0784).
TEM image of g1 was shown in Fig. 2(a). It shows the formation of smaller nanoparticles of spherical, decahedron and little triangles in the range of 5–20 nm with an average of ~16 nm. Decahedron (Fig. 2(a) (inset)) is a strained structure but possesses a slightly more efficient space-filling structure. It is an equilibrium shape bound completely by triangular (111) facets and can be thought of as five tetrahedral sharing a common edge along a fivefold axis. The presence of multiply twining in AuNPs observed in Fig. 2(a) (inset), which exhibit near fivefold symmetry.
