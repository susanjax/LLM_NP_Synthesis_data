Preparation of salt solution
To make 0.2 M concentration salt solution take analytical amount of 1.698 g silver nitrate dissolved in 50 ml of distilled water then heated for 15 min at 80 °C will continuously stirring at 8000 rpm

Synthesis of silver nanoparticles
Take 6 0 ml of filtrate of leaves extracts in burette and 30 ml of salt solution obtained in beaker. The leaves extract was heated and titrated against salt solution on magnetic stirrer in the ratio of 2:1 at 80–90 °C. Drop wise addition of plant extract in silver nitrate salt solution that change the color of salt solution to dark brown to pale yellow. Then, the solution was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 15–20 min the dark blackish brown precipitate formed that indicated the formation of silver nanoparticles. After this the supernatant was removed and the pellet containing nanoparticles were washed (two–three times) with distilled water and nanoparticles were air dried at room temperature

Crystalline nature, structure and grain size of silver nanoparticles were confirmed and determined by XRD. Intense Bragg reflections suggest that strong X-ray scattering centers in the crystalline phase and could be due to capping agents. XRD results also suggested that the crystallization of the bio-organic phase occurs on the surface of the silver nanoparticles or vice versa (

). XRD analysis showed amorphous graph that showed different diffraction peaks at 20.8, 38, 57.8, 75.9 at 33°, 27°, 24° and 23° correspond to different plans. The crystalline plans of the face centered cubic structure of metallic silver. In the bioreduction process, the average grain size of the silver nanoparticles is estimated to be. 48.12 nm calculated through sherrer equation. All these results are aligned to the previous reported work of various scientists
