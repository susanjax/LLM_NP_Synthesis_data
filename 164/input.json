Preparation of AuNPs
In a glass vial (25 mL), pure water (15.8 mL) and a solution of tetrachloroauric acid salt (0.18 mL, 5.0 mM, in pure water) were well mixed via magnetic stirring. Then, a solution of sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 0.4 mL, 1.0 mM, in pure water) was prepared and freshly added into the vial. The emergence of the red color in the solution occurred through the reduction of the gold ions to the pure metallic nanoparticles. Ultimately, a solution of trisodium citrate (0.18 mL, 5.0 mM, in pure water) was added into the vial for stabilization of the formed AuNPs.

To investigate the size, morphology and composition state of the particles, field-emission scanning-electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission-electron microscopy (TEM) were used. As illustrated in Fig. 4aâ€“c, the tubular shape of the halloysite nanoparticles is clearly identified in the FESEM images.
