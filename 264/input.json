Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles
Silver nitrate solution (2 mM) was prepared by dissolving AgNO3 (0.0017 g) in 50 mL of deionized water. This solution was mixed with 1 mL of the aqueous plant extract. The mixture was irradiated using a domestic microwave oven (Modena MG 2516) operating at 900 Watt for 1.5 minutes. A UV-Vis spectrometer was applied to monitor the reaction mixture. The centrifugation was conducted at 10 000 rpm for 30 min to separate the supernatant and precipitate silver nanoparticles. The precipitate was collected and then washed thrice with deionized water to remove impurities. The purified sample was dried in an oven at 70 °C to obtain black powder silver nanoparticles.
DLS measurements were accomplished to obtain the hydrodynamic particle size, zeta potential, and polydispersity index (PI) of the biosynthesized AgNPs. As shown in Fig. 3, the average particle size (Z-average) of the biosynthesized AgNPs (Fig. 3A) was 88.8 nm with the PI value of 0.355 (Fig. 3A) indicating that the nanoparticles were relatively monodispersed and the zeta potential showed negative charge with a value of −27.4 mV (Fig. 3B). The obtained particle size is the hydrodynamic size determined by the accumulation of the metal core size, the size of the capping agents or biomolecules attached to the silver nanoparticles, and the electrical double layer between particles.39 Therefore, the average size of the biosynthesized AgNPs based on DLS analysis is larger than that by macroscopic analysis, such as SEM or TEM. Nanoparticles with a size below 150 nm and a PI value of 0.3 are capable of cellular uptake.40 The negative zeta potential value reveals that the negatively charged functional groups of the plant extract play important roles in the stability of the colloidal silver nanoparticles.41
FE SEM and EDX measurements were conducted to obtain the morphology and elemental composition of the synthesized silver nanoparticles. The spherical silver nanoparticles are observed in Fig. 4. Image J software was used to calculate the average size of the silver nanoparticles, which was 21.63 ± 4.85 nm. The size and shape of the nanoparticles affect their biological activity. Smaller nanoparticles can more easily penetrate cells leading to them being more cytotoxic against cancer cells and more efficient against microbial pathogens in comparison with larger particles.42,43 Moreover, the spherical structure of nanoparticles has a larger specific surface area generating more damage to the bacterial cell as compared to nanorods and nanowires with smaller surface area.44
The XRD pattern of the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles is exhibited in Fig. 6. The five distinct diffraction peaks of 2θ values were observed at 38.11°, 44.25°, 64.41°, 77.45°, and 81.33° corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes. A similar result was reported by Jayaprakash et al., who demonstrated that the synthesized silver nanoparticles have a face-centred cubic (FCC) structure.52 The d spacing values presented at 2.3590 Å, 2.0453 Å, 1.4454 Å, 1.2313 Å, and 1.1821 Å are matched with the standard silver values.53 The additional peaks observed in Fig. 6 were due to the presence of organic compounds from the extract as reducing and stabilizing agents.54 The average crystalline size calculated using the Scherrer formula was observed to be 7.428 nm.
