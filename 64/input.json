Biosynthesis and purification of gold nanoparticles
Bacillus sp. (SJ 14) isolated and characterized for silver nanoparticle (AgNPs) synthesizing property in our previous study [18] was also selected as source organism for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles using aqueous solution of gold(III) chloride hydrate (HAuCl4; Sigma-Aldrich). Bacterial biomass was grown in a specially prepared liquid culture medium (0.5 % peptone, 0.15 % beef extract, 0.15 % yeast extract, and 1 % NaCl, pH 7). The inoculated broth was maintained at room temperature under constant agitation at 200 rpm in a rotating shaker for 24 h. After incubation, the biomass was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min and washed thoroughly with sterile deionized water to remove any adhering media components. About 2 g of bacterial wet biomass was resuspended in 100-mL aqueous solution of filter-sterilized 1 mM HAuCl4 in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles. The bacterial biomass incubated without chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) was maintained as control. After synthesis, the whole bacterial mixture with AuNPs was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and the collected pellets were washed and resuspended in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7). The cells were disrupted by ultrasonication over three 15-s periods and with an interval of 45 s between periods (Sonics-Vibra Cell). The resulting solution was then filtered through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore), and the purified AuNPs thus obtained was used for further characterization.
Characterization of gold nanoparticles
The morphological analysis of the gold nanoparticles was done with HR-TEM. It was found that the synthesized nanoparticles were predominantly spherical in shape. In addition, hexagonal and triangular nanoparticles were also found and the sizes of formed AuNPs were in the range of 12–32 nm (Fig. 4a–g). The corresponding image of SAED patterns with bright circular spots revealed the biosynthesized gold nanoparticles as crystalline in nature (Fig. 4h). The EDS spectrum of AuNPs showed strong signals at 1.5 keV, which confirmed the presence of elemental gold in the sample (Fig. 4i).
