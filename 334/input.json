Synthesis of silver Nanoparticles-Kaempferol
The synthesis of silver nanoparticles-kaempferol was done by green synthesis methods (Hairil Anuar et al., 2022). Synthesizing silver nanoparticles-kaempferol (AgNPs-K) was done in the ratio of 9:1 based on its volume. In this research, 900 mL of 1 mM aqueous silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution was added drop by drop with 100 mL of 1 mM of aqueous kaempferol (C15H10O6) solution under vigorous stirring for 30 min. Both silver nitrate and kaempferol used ultrapure water (H2O) as their solvent. The solution was then incubated in the oven (Memmert UF 110, Germany) for 168 h at 60 ˚C. The reduction of silver nitrate to silver ions was confirmed by the color changes from colorless to reddish brown. The solution was then freeze-dried (Christ Alpha 1–4 LSC basic, Germany) to obtain the AgNPs-K powder.
