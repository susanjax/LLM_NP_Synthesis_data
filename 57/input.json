Green synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles
Green synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles was performed as described earlier by Krishnasamy et al. (2015) with modifications. Briefly, 10 mL of Azadirachta indica leaf broth was added to 90 mL of 5 mM of aqueous titanium dioxide for synthesis of nanoparticles. The titanium dioxide nanoparticles were purified by repeated centrifugation at 7826 × g for 20 min using double distilled water and pellet was dispersed in the deionized water. Finally, heat treatment was given at 60 °C for 1 h and stored for further use.
Characterization of nanoparticles
White colored titanium dioxide nanoparticles were prepared using the extract of Azadirachta indica and characterized using XRD, SEM, TEM and FT-IR spectroscopy. XRD patterns of green synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles were observed at 25.36, 26.54, 37.05, 37.78, 38.54, 48.12, 54.02 and 55.04° can be attributed to the 101, 110, 103, 004, 112, 200, 105 and 211 crystalline anatase and rutile structures of synthesized titanium dioxide nanoparticles (Fig. 1). These results were confirmed using Joint Committee on Power Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) No. 21-1272 and 21-1276. The average crystalline size of synthesized nanoparticles was 41.9 nm calculated using Scherrer's equation (D = Kλ/βcosθ). λ is the wavelength of x-ray radiation (CuKα = 0.15406 nm), K is a constant taken as 0.89, β is the line width at half maximum height (FWHM) of peak and θ is the diffracting angle. The average crystalline size of synthesized nanoparticles is 15–45 nm calculated by Scherrer's formula based on the XRD pattern (Patterson, 1939).
The surface morphology and size of the TiO2 nanoparticles were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which revealed that TiO2 nanoparticles were spherical and their size was in range from 25 to 87 nm (Fig. 2). TEM studies showed that the nanoparticles are spherical in shape with smooth surfaces and the size in range 15–45 nm which is in close covenant with that estimated by Scherrer's formula based on the XRD pattern (Fig. 3 a).
