Biosynthesis of bimetallic ZnO-CuO NPs utilizing the biomass filtrate from A. niger AH1
Three discs of the fungal strain A. niger AH1 (7 mm in diameter) were inoculated on MEB broth medium and incubated for 5 d at 28°C ± 2°C, pH adjusted to 6.0, and shaking conditions (150 rpm). Following the incubation period, the collected biomass (15g) was rinsed with deionized and sterilized H2O, then resuspended in 100 mL of distilled water at 28°C ± 2°C, 150 rpm for 3d. Filtration was carried out to obtain the fungal biomass filtrate, which was then used to make ZnO-CuO NPs as follows: 2.0 mM of zinc acetate pentahydrate and 4.0 mM of CuSO4•5H2O were added to 100 mL of fungal biomass filtrate for 24 h at 28°C ± 2°C, 150 rpm, pH 9 in the dark. A dark green color appeared in the filtrate, which was then oven-dried at 120°C for 24 h

Fig. 1C
 has illustrated the XRD patterns of ZnO-CuO NPs and ZnO-CuO NPs/CSC. Consequently, the ZnO-CuO NP pattern was observed in both ZnO and CuO patterns. For ZnO, peaks were presented at 2θ = 31.66°, 34.26°, 36.06°, 47.56°, 56.43°, 62.84° and match well with the PDF card (JCPDS No.36–1451) of the Wurtzite structure of ZnO
[58]
. Furthermore, for CuO, the diffraction peaks were recorded at 2θ = 36.06°, 38.76°, 59°, 62.7°, 67.5°, 68.8° and 73.5° and it confirms that the monoclinic phase of CuO is well matched with standard JCPDS (48–1548)

. In other words, the nanocomposite ZnO-CuO NPs/CSC pattern has assigned two humps of carbohydrate polymer at around 11° and 21° that reported the chitosan and nanocellulose
[61]
. Additionally, the ZnO and CuO peaks were observed with low intensity as well.

Topographical study included SEM and TEM, as well as EDX and SAED patterns were observed in
Fig. 2
. The SEM image in
Fig. 2A
 has shown a bimetallic with metallic shiny particle aggregated with a size lowest than 50 nm. In addition, the nanocomposite (
Fig. 2B
) has observed ZnO-CuO NPs attached to the surface of nanocomposite matrix at low magnification. Additionally, the high magnification was performed in ZnO-CuO NPs coated and attached with ZnO-CuO NPs/CSC matrix and formed a rough surface that could be occupied in dye adsorption. Moreover, the EDX chart of ZnO-CuO NPs (
Fig. 2C
) has shown atoms that contain zinc, copper and oxygen. However, ZnO-CuO NPs/CSC (
Fig. 2D
) has clear presences of copper, zinc and oxygen atoms. Besides, the TEM images of nanocomposite with low and high magnifications (
Fig. 2E
 and
F
) were performed by the intermolecular structure of ZnO-CuO NPs/CSC as a network of polysaccharide matrix doped with ZnO-CuO NPs. In addition, the SEAD (
Fig. 2F
) observed a polycrystalline nature of ZnO-CuO NPs/CSC that could relate to the intermolecular structure observed by TEM image.
