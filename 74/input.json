Synthesis of ZnO Nanorods
Several routes synthesized ZnO nanorods, but one of the best methods is the sol–gel method with some modifications (Nouroozi and Farzaneh, 2011). In a typical synthesis, 1.1 gram of zinc acetate dihydrate [Zn (CH3COO)2.2H2O] was added in 10 ml of ultrapure water (Milli-Q water, United States) (18 M Ω) containing 2 gm of albumin added gradually with 30 min stirring. The oven performed the calcination process at 300°C for 6 h, and then, the precipitates were annealed slowly and characterized (Supplementary Figure S1).
Zinc Oxide Nanorod Characterization
XRD patterns of ZnO nanorods are shown in Figure 2. The peaks at 2 θ = 31.746, 34.395, 36.226, 47.526, 56.549, 62.832, 67.893, and 69.028 were assigned to (100), (002), (101), (110), (103), (200), (112), and (201) of ZnO nanorods. All peaks indicated a hexagon wurtzite structure (Zincite, JCPDS no, 89–0510). The results indicated the high quality of ZnO nanorods. The average crystal sizes of ZnO-NRs obtained after calcination at 300°C for five hours have confirmed their rod shape with 285 nm length and 84 nm diameter. Scherer's equation (Patterson, 1939; Cullity and Stock, 2001) evaluated the average crystallite size (4) of ZnO-NRs.
