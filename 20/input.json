Synthesis of silver nanoparticles from Klebsiella pneumoniae
AgNPs were synthesized using primary broth culture of Kp was added in 200 ml of Nutrient Broth in test tubes with one control (without inoculation). After inoculation, the test tubes were incubated at 37Â°C for 24 h in a shaker incubator. After the 24 h of incubation, the culture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected in other autoclaved test tubes, and the pellet was discarded. 2 mM AgNO3 was added to the supernatant of Kp under sterilized conditions, and the tubes were monitored at the regular interval for color change.
Characterization of silver nanoparticles
The synthesis of AgNPs was confirmed by UV-visible spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The change in color of AgNO3 treated culture supernatant initially indicated the formation of AgNPs. TEM analysis was also done to further characterize the nanoparticles and it was found that synthesized AgNPs were nearly 20 nm sizes and found to be well dispersed in aqueous medium [Figure 3]. FTIR analysis was also done for the characterization of AgNPs. FTIR absorption spectrum of AgNP powder is shown in Figure 4.
