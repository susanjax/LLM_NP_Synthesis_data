 Rumex nervosus leaves collection and extraction
Rumex nervosus leaves were collected on April 2nd, 2019 from Sameaa district, Taiz City, Republic of Yemen. The botanical identification of the plant was established by Prof. A Shahzad, Department of Botany, AMU, India. Fresh leaves were washed with tap water, then with distilled water, dried in the shade, and finally ground into powder form with the help of a grinder. About 30g of powdered leaves were boiled in 100 ml of deionized water to prepare the aqueous extract until the final volume was decreased to half of the initial volume. To get rid of any solid particles, Whatman No. 1 filter paper was used to filter the leaf extract [

 Silver nanoparticles biosynthesis
Rn-AgNPs green synthesis was achieved by using increasing concentrations of AgNO3 solution. It was mixed with 500 μl of leaf extract. The final volume of the reaction mixture was kept 5 ml with deionized water. The reaction mixture was incubated for various time periods at 25 °C and stirred on a rotatory incubator with a speed of 180 rpm. The as-formed nanoprecipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10000 g for 10 min and rinsed twice with deionized water, After the washing, the residue was transferred to a freeze dryer to obtain the free-flowing powder, and was preserved for further studies.
Characterization
 The TEM pictures showed that the biosynthesized Rn-AgNPs were uniformly distributed, having a spherical shape with the presence of some hexagonal, and oval particles. The size of Rn-AgNPs was found to be 20–70 nm with an average size of 56±2 nm according to the TEM image as shown in

B depicts the particle size distribution curve of the biosynthesized AgNPs. It was found in various sizes to be in a range of 40-90 nm, with an average size of 62±3 nm and a polydispersity index (PDI) value of 0.45. The size of the majority of Rn-AgNPs was related to the results of TEM. However, it should be noted that DLS measured values are typically slightly larger than TEM measurements due to the hydrodynamic diameter that is taken into account in DLS because it measures diffusion in particle dispersions, which can be solved using the Stokes-Einstein equation to obtain an ensemble average hydrodynamic particle diameter. Hence, a disparity in size estimation between DLS and TEM may occur. The zeta potential was performed to measure the surface charge value of Rn-AgNPs, which was determined to be around -22 mV as shown in
Fig. 4
C. The stability of nanoparticles is related to zeta potential values ranging from (+30 mV) to (-30 mV). Hence, the sufficient charge on the surface of NPs which is compatible with the repulsive force will stop the NPs agglomeration.
