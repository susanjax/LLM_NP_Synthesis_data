Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs@PCS)
The fabrication of AgNPs was carried out using the following procedure. Initially, an aqueous solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3) was prepared by dissolving 24 mg of silver nitrate in 10 ml of deionized water, resulting in a concentration of 15 mM. The solution was vigorously stirred during the preparation. Simultaneously, an aqueous solution of Petroselinum crispum extract was prepared by adding 0.1 g of the extract to 10 ml of deionized water, adjusting the pH to 12. Next, the aqueous solution of Petroselinum crispum extract was added to the silver nitrate solution, and the mixture was stirred for 60 min. During this process, the Ag+ ions were reduced to Ag0 nanoparticles. The fabricated AgNPs@PCS were then subjected to centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 6 min and washed with double distilled water. Finally, the AgNPs@PCS were dried in an oven for 24 h.

The crystalline structure of the fabricated nanoparticles was assessed through XRD analysis, as depicted in
Fig. 2
. The XRD results displayed four distinct peaks at 2θ angles of 38.2°, 44.22°, 64.92°, and 77.5°, corresponding to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) Bragg planes, respectively. These findings indicate the formation of a cubic crystal structure at the core of the AgNPs. Moreover, the obtained results were consistent with the reference data from the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS 01–087-0717), confirming the high purity of the fabricated nanoparticles as no additional peaks were observed. The outcomes of this study aligned with the findings reported by Ghoshal et al. (
Ghoshal and Singh, 2022
). The average crystal size of the fabricated nanoparticles was determined using the Debye-Scherr equation (D = 0.9λ/βcosθ (4)), where D represents the average crystal size, λ represents the wavelength, β represents the peak width at half maximum intensity, and θ represents the Bragg angle. According to this calculation, the average crystal size of the fabricated nanoparticles was estimated to be 38.7 nm.

EDS, FESEM and TEM analysis
The EDS diagram of the fabricated nanoparticles, as illustrated in
Fig. 3
, exhibited a prominent peak at 3 KeV, primarily associated with AgNPs. Also, small amount of carbon and oxygen were observed in the graph, which is associated to the elements in the extract of Petroselinum crispum on the surface of the fabricated nanoparticles. The results of this analysis were in consistent with the results of Rautela et al. study (
Rautela et al., 2019
). FESEM images of fabricated nanoparticles showed the formation of spherical, uniform and homogeneous nanoparticles (
Fig. 4
). According to these tests, the average size of the fabricated nanoparticles was approximately 30–50 nm. As it is clear, irregular structure that was observed in some areas was related to the aggregation of nanoparticles which can be attributed to the adhesion of the extract on the surface of the NPs. Dinparvar et al., reported the fabricated AgNPs using Cuminum cyminum L. seed extract and the SEM images of the fabricated nanoparticles showed that the size of the fabricated nanoparticles was about 100 nm. Our data indicated that use of Petroselinum crispum extract smaller AgNPs nanoparticles can be fabricated (
Dinparvar et al., 2020
). Furthermore, TEM spectroscopy was used to obtain the precise size and morphology of the fabricated nanoparticles (
Fig. 5
). The images clearly showed the spherical and uniform shape of the sample no. 14 with the size around 30–50 nm. The existence of a dark shadow around the fabricated nanoparticles in the TEM images confirmed the placement of Petroselinum crispum plant extract on the surface of the fabricated nanoparticles. Ragupathi and his colleagues utilized Petroselinum crispum plant extract to synthesize silver nanoparticles (
Ragupathi et al., 2016
). However, their research resulted in nanoparticles with a rod-like morphology and significant agglomeration. In contrast, our study achieved nanoparticles with more suitable size and morphology, offering an improvement over the previous research.
