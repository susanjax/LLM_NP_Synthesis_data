PAAc hydrogel formation and Ag NPs preparation
A predefined amount of partially neutralized AAc monomers (1%) was prepared by dropwise addition of NaOH solution under cooling in an ice bath. To prepare PAAc hydrogel, 48.6 ml aqueous solution of partially neutralized acrylic acid with a concentration of 1.5 M was prepared and mixed with 25 ml aqueous solution of AgNO3 (15 mM) at room temperature. 0.0015 mol KPS (2% moles of AAc) dissolved in 25 ml doubled distilled water was then added for initiating the free radical polymerization system and the solution was stirred sufficiently to dissolve it. The solution was kept under a nitrogen atmosphere to avoid any undesirable oxygen. The solution heated up to 65 °C to initiate the polarization process. After 60 min of polymerization, the solution was cooled and then the PAAc hydrogel cross-linked with Ag+ ions (Ag+/PAAc composite hydrogel) was obtained. The resulting hydrogel sample was removed and cut in the form of discs (20 mm in diameter and 6 mm in length). These disc shaped samples was quickly immersed in an aqueous solution of NaBH4 (3 M), and kept for 24 h to complete the reduction of Ag+ ions to Ag NPs with the absorption of the solution. The white color of the swelling hydrogel was gradually changed to yellow, indicating the formation of Ag NPs in the PAAc network. Finally, the hydrogels were immersed in excess double distilled water for 24 h. The samples remained in water to reach equilibrium swelling for removal of unreacted and soluble components. All swelled materials were dried under a vacuum at 50 ± 2 °C. The sample preparation method and immobilization process are schematically shown in
Fig. 1
. The pure PAAc was also prepared by free radical polymerization using the similar procedure, described above.

To further investigate the formation of Ag NPs inside PAAc network and study their crystal structure, X-ray analysis was used.
Fig. 4
 show the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the pure PAAc, Ag+/PAAc composite hydrogel and Ag NPs/PAAc nanocomposite hydrogel. The XRD pattern of all samples shows a non-crystalline broad peak centered at 2θ = ∼26°, which is due to the amorphous polymeric structure of PAAc [

,

]. Four sharp intense peaks for nanocomposite sample (
Fig. 4
a) at 2θ of 38.2°, 44.4°, 64.6° and 77.7° confirm the formation of Ag NPs in PAAc network [
30
,
41
]. These XRD peaks are related to the face-centered cubic (FCC) crystalline structure of metallic Ag and correspond to (111), (200), (220), (311) lattice planes of Ag NPs grown in the PAAc matrix. Hence, the XRD results show that the Ag NPs were successfully fabricated inside the PAAc hydrogel composite. No XRD peaks corresponding to Ag oxide were observed, which confirms that only metallic Ag NPs were prepared by in situ reduction.
For preserving the structure of pores and observing the porosity of samples, a freeze dryer was used.
Fig. 5
a shows the cross-sectional micrographs of freeze-dried Ag+/PAAc hydrogel composite hydrogel. Obviously, this sample has a highly porous and honeycomb-like structure with an approximate pore size of 10 μm in diameter. The regular pores in this sample are connected with each other to form capillary channels, which remarkably can affect the migration of water [
43
] and the swelling behavior of hydrogel. The interconnectivity of the pores in the samples could be assigned to the crosslinking of PAAc chains by Ag+ ions. The surface of air-dried Ag+/PAAc hydrogel composite hydrogel is very flat and so its porous structure is not observable in
Fig. 5
b.

The cross-sectional view of Ag NPs/PAAc nanocomposite hydrogel in
Fig. 5
c shows the channel-like structure and large pores compared to the cross-sectional view of the freeze-dried composite sample (
Fig. 5
d). These remarkable changes in pore size and morphology between two samples of freeze-dried composite and nanocomposite hydrogels are observable in
Fig. 5
 a and b. This can be due to the equilibrium swelling of nanocomposite during the reduction process of Ag + ions to Ag0 in the PAAc network. In fact, the high porosity in the freeze-dried nanocomposite micrograph arises from the evaporation of a large amount of water from the swollen sample. Also, in
Fig. 5
d air-dried Ag NPs/PAAc nanocomposite hydrogel has a relatively flat and dense structure and few pores compared to the freeze-dried nanocomposite sample. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of the Ag NPs/PAAc nanocomposite hydrogel was performed to understand the existence of Ag NPs in the PAAc network. EDX result of this sample are shown in
Fig. 6
. In the EDX pattern, the signal peaks of the carbon, oxygen and Ag elements are clearly seen, implying that the NPs are silver due to the absorbance band at about 3 keV [
44
]. EDX result provides direct evidence that Ag NPs are synthesized inside the PAAc network. The yellow color of Ag NPs/PAAc nanocomposite hydrogel also suggests the formation of Ag NPs in the PAAc. Furthermore, EDX spectra indicate a weight composition equal to 0.81 % of Ag in the sample which corresponds to 0.1 % of the Ag atomic composition.
Although the FESEM results in
Fig. 5
c with the magnification of 60,000 also confirm the presence of nanoparticles in the polymer matrix, the image is not clear enough for a more precise study of the size and morphology of Ag NPs. The Ag NPs are too small to be seen in the FESEM image. TEM analysis was utilized to characterize more convincing evidence for Ag NPs.
Fig. 7
 shows the TEM images of Ag NPs inside the PAAc and colloid. It is clearly observed from the TEM image that the ultrafine spherical Ag NPs with a diameter of 5–10 nm are successfully formed by the polymerization-reduction approach and homogeneously dispersed in the PAAc matrix. On the other hand, Ag NPs synthesized in colloid (
Fig. 7
b) show a lot of aggregations and their clusters are far away from homogeneous dispersion. In comparison with
Fig. 7
a and b, it is found that PAAc polymer can act as a better host matrix for Ag NPs and prevent the NPs aggregations as a better-stabilizing agent in the current synthesis method.
