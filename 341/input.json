 Silver nanosuspension preparation
Ethanolic (70%) tincture of Calendula off. flowers were diluted with purified water in a ratio of 1:50. The diluted plant extract was mixed with 1 mM silver nitrate in a ratio 1 to 1. The plant extract acts as a stabilizer and reducing agent. The final concentration of starting materials in the reaction mixture was: 1% ethanol tincture of Calendula off. and 0.47 mM silver nitrate. In order to assess the synthesis of AgNPs with a plant extract at different pH values, the resulting solution was divided into 3 parts and titrated with a 0.01 M NH4OH solution to different pH values: acidic (pH5), neutral (pH7), alkaline (pH9). The same series of solutions was prepared using NaOH as pH adjuster instead of NH4OH. The synthesis was carried out under the influence of the following physical factors:
Method I AgNPs@UV. The reaction mixture (V 60 ml) with different pH(5; 7 and 9) values of the reaction mixture silver nitrate and the diluted with water 1:50 extract were exposed to UV radiation under a UV lamp at a stirring of 150 rpm for 60 min (6 times for 10 min measuring OD460 in between) at room temperature; UV Lamp (Philips, China): power 30 W, Voltage 220 V, Frequency 50 Hz, Current 0.14 A, Emission peak at 253.7 nm, Tube diameter (D) 26 mm, Radiator length (A) 894.6 mm, Length with plinth (B) 907.1 mm, Overall length (C) 908.8 mm, Lamp weight 0.12 kg.
Method II AgNPs@MW. The reaction mixture (V 60 ml) with different pH(5; 7 and 9) values were subjected to microwave radiation (MW radiation) at a power of 140 W for 180 s (9 times 20 s). With each microwave radiation cycle allowed the solutions to be heated up to 33–36 °C;
Method III AgNPs@HT. The reaction mixture at different pH were subjected to heat in a water bath at a temperature of 80 °C for 60 min (6 times for 10 min measuring OD460 in between). After each heat treatment, the temperature of the samples reached 80 °C.

 After a month of AgNPs storage the hydrodynamic radius main fraction was approximately 40–50 nm. The AgNPs average hydrodynamic particle size significantly depends on the pH conditions and the method of synthesis (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Particle sizes differ by 31.5%–50% depending on the pH of solution during the synthesis as well as the method of acceleration of reaction: AgNPs@MW are larger than AgNPs@UV. It should be noted that the sizes of AgNPs in suspensions with an initial neutral and alkaline medium did not differ significantly, regardless of the type of external additional impact (UV, MW, heat) (Table 4).
In this regard, the excitation and emission of surface Plasmon oscillations were previously used as a guideline for characterizing the size and shape of silver nanoparticles. Under red, green and blue LED light AgNPs stabilized, when Calendula off. flower extract (water was used for extraction) can be prepared with hydrodynamic diameters in the range of 89–175 nm (Santos et al., 2022). Incubation of aqueous extract from dry leaves of Calendula off. with silver ions at 30 °C leads to spherical shape AgNPs in the range of 38 to 75 nm, that characterized with SPR wavelength peak at 452 nm (Xu et al., 2023). From the other side aqueous extract from fruits Calendula off. flowers converted to AgNPs suspension exhibited SPR peak maximum located between 400–550 nm and with average size of 40 nm according to XRD analysis (Khshan and Alkafaje). TEM images analysis confirmed appearing a capping layer with a thickness of 3–5 nm around the biosynthesized AgNPs (El-Kemary et al., 2016). Surface Plasmon resonance OD460 increased in direct proportion to the reaction time, while the pH value decreased due to accumulation of nitrate ions. The UV–Vis spectra of AgNPs synthesized by UV-irradiation in alkaline medium have a narrower peak range (peak observed at 460 nm, that corresponds to AgNPs average size of 80–85 nm compared to AgNPs synthesized at acidic and neutral conditions (Fig. 2A). The same trend was observed in both cases when exposed to
 radiation (Fig. 2B), and when exposed to incubation at high temperature the peak is observed at 469 nm.
