Preparation and Characterization of Phenylboronic acid-derivative-modified
AuNPs
We prepared phenylboronic acid-derivative-modified Au NPs by the one-pot synthesis
method with the reduction of HAuCl4•3H2O by NaBH4 in water. We mixed the
solution of small molecules (0.1 mmol, ABA or MBA) in 10 mL double-distilled
water, HAuCl4•3H2O (0.1 mmol), triethylamine (50 μL) and Tween 80 (30 mg) for 10
min in an ice-water bath. We added NaBH4 (6 mg dissolved in 2 mL water) dropwise
in the above mixture with vigorous stirring (1000 rpm). The color of the solution
turned brown immediately and we kept stirring the solution for an additional 2 h. We
synthesized A/M-AuNPs with different mass ratios of 4ABA and 4MBA (75:25, 50:50,
25:75) following the protocol mentioned above. 
0.1 mmol HAuCl4•3H2O dissolved in 100 mL double-distilled water was heated to
boiling at 600 rpm. 114 mg sodium citrate dissolved in 100 mL double-distilled water
was added into the bottle containing HAuCl4•3H2O and stirred for 10 min at 1500
S2
rpm to obtain AuNPs (bare AuNPs). We incubated different concentrations of MBA
or ABA with the bare AuNPs solution for 12 h and centrifuged the product at 8000
rpm for 10 min to remove the untreated chemicals.
The particle size of the AuNPs capped with different ligands is 4 ± 0.4 nm (A-AuNPs) and 3 ±
0.6 nm (M-AuNPs) (Figure 2A-B). 
For A/M-AuNPs with different molar ratios of ABA and MBA (2:1, 1:1, 1:2), the sizes are 4 ±
0.3 nm, 4 ± 0.6 nm and 4 ± 0.8 nm respectively (Figure 2A-B). Zeta potential measurements indicate that all the AuNPs are negatively charged (Figure 2B). Dynamic light scanning (DLS)
curves indicate that there is no large aggregation in the particle solution (Figure 2C).
