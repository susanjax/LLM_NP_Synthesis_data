Synthesis of NiO-NPs
Green synthesis of the NiO NPs was carried out using the methods demonstrated in previous reports with minor modifications. For the synthesis of NiO NPs, 40 mL of 0.1 M C4H6NiO4 solution was added to 10 mL of 10% flower extract of Clitoria ternatea. The flower extract acts as a reducing and capping agent. The reaction solution color changed from violet to bluish green indicating the formation of NiO NPs. The obtained precipitate was subjected to centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min, followed by washing with DI water to remove impurities and dried at 60 °C for 6 h. Later, the dried powder was calcinated in a muffle furnace for 2 h at 400 °C. The resultant powder was used for further studies.

Fig. 4
 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern with intense and sharp peaks which demonstrate that the synthesized NiO NPs are pure and crystalline in nature. The XRD peaks observed at 2θ angles of 37.40, 43.50, 63.080, and 75.60 representing (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) planes, respectively, of the cubic crystal structure matched with JCPDS NO 47–1049 (

. The crystallite size of the NiO NPs was calculated using the Debye-Scherrer formula,
where, λ, β and θ are the X-ray wavelength, full width at half maximum (FWHM) of XRD diffraction peaks, and angle of Bragg diffraction, respectively
[26]
. The average crystalline size of the NiO NPs was calculated to be 9.62 nm. The calculated average crystallite size of the CuO NPs was in concordance with the previous findings
[35]
. The various phytochemicals present in the aqueous flower extract of Clitoria ternatea acting as a reducing and capping agent are primarily responsible for smaller crystallite size of NiO NPs
[34]
. The synthesized NiO NPs with high crystallinity corresponding with reduced particle size and high surface area would give effective antibacterial and catalytic activities.

The HRTEM micrographs of the NiO NPs at two different magnifications (100 and 10 nm) are shown in
Fig. 6
a and 6b. At a magnification of 10 nm, it can be observed that the NPs are hexagonal in shape and non-agglomerated. The d-spacing between the planes was found to be 0.218 nm corresponding to (2 0 0) plane of NiO (

c. This result confirmed the synthesized NPs were pure crystalline in nature. The Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) pattern of the synthesized NiO NPs in
Fig. 5
d shows diffraction rings with concentric circles. These rings correspond to the different diffraction planes namely (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), and (2 2 2) planes, which can be indexed to the cubic crystal structure that matches with the XRD data

. The average particle size calculated from the size distribution histogram (
Fig. 7
 was found to be 13 nm, which is in concordance with XRD results. The EDAX analysis that confirms the presence of nickel and oxygen elements (

. The as-synthesized NiO NPs are composed of 80.69% of Ni and 1.34% of oxygen. In addition, the atomic % of Ni was found to be 78.93 and oxygen 4.84. There is no affirmation for the appearance of impurities. The decrease in particle size (13 nm) leads to an increase in the surface area and this enhances the photocatalytic and antibacterial applications
