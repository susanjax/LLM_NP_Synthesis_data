Synthesis of NiO NPs
In 500 mL of deionized water, 0.73 g of nickel nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved to create a 5 mM stock solution. For the creation of NiO NPs, 45 mL of the stock solution and 15 mL of P. emodi leaf extract were homogenized under stirring. A suitable quantity of NaOH solution was added to keep the pH at 10. At 50 °C, the reaction mixture was stirred for 90 min and was then allowed to cool at room temperature for 24 h. Centrifugation was used to separate the solid product, which was extensively cleaned with deionized water before being treated with analytical grade ethanol. In an electric oven, the resultant product was dried at 100 °C before being stored in a sealed sample vial.
Characterization of NiO NPs
The XRD pattern of NiO NPs reveals three diffraction peaks with corresponding hkl values of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) at 37.32, 43.36, and 62.94 as shown in Fig. 2a. The cubic geometry of the synthesized NiO NPs was confirmed by the peaks and hkl values, which corresponded with peaks noted on JCPDS card 01–073-1519. The crystallite size of 22.37 nm and the crystallographic defect of 0.401 % were determined by the Debye-Scherrer equation. The presence of elements in the sample, their percentage and purity of NiO NPs was explored by using an EDX analysis (Fig. 2b). The intense Ni peaks at 0.8, 7.9, and 8.5 keV, as well as a signal at 0.6 keV ascribed to O and a band at 0.4 keV assigned to C, are visible in the EDX spectrum of the examined sample. Ni, O, and C all have weight percentages of 73.4, 25.2, and 1.4 %, respectively. The carbon tape used to stack the samples caused the C peak in the spectrum (Anand et al., 2020).
The morphology of NiO NPs was extracted from the low and high-magnified SEM micrographs given in Fig. 3(a and b). The low magnification SEM micrograph (Fig. 3a) shows mixed morphology of the sample. Many small sized particles are irregularly scattered led to the formation of porous like structure while other are closely connected with one another, forming larger sheet like structures. The high magnified SEM (Fig. 3b) shows that the particles with visible boundaries are closely connected with each other, although some cavity are also seen due to the uneven distribution of the NPs. The non-uniform size and shape of the particles are due to the interaction of the NPs to each other through weak attractive forces (Hafeez et al., 2021). An SEM micrograph revealed NPs sizes ranging from 21.74 to 89.57 nm, with an average size of 58.86 nm (Fig. 3b). The wide size range of several NPs are due to the dehydration of the sample and it also believed that the NPs has high surface energy and by aggregates formation the NPs disintegrate their energy and become stable (Saravanan et al., 2018).
