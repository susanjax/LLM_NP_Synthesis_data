Green synthesis of platinum nanoparticles
Biological synthesis of Pt NPs was performed by using the following procedure. Briefly, 10 mM PtCl4 solution was added to 220 mL pomegranate extract and executed in ultrasonic conditions using an ultrasonic tip sonicator. The solution was magnetically stirred at room temperature for 24 h. A color change was observed from yellow to brown, which indicated the formation of platinum nanoparticles. The obtained Pt NPs was purified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 15,000 rpm, which was repeated two times. Next, the final pellet obtained was washed three times with ethanol and dried in a vacuum oven.
characterization of biosynthesized monodisperse Pt NPs
The newly biosynthesized monodisperse Pt NPs have been characterized by using several different techniques such as XRD, TEM, HRTEM and EELS. The TEM measurements were applied to determine the particle morphology and size of the prepared Pt NPs. As illustrated in Fig. 2a and b, the particles have a spherical shape, and the particle size is well distributed with an average particle size of 20.12 nm. The atomic lattice fringes of the prepared Pt nanoparticles were observed to be 0.22 nm, which is exactly same as the nominal Pt value in the literature [36,37]. In addition, the EELS line profile also indicates the existence of Pt nanoparticles in prepared composites as seen in Fig. 2c.  As shown in Fig. 2d, the obtained Pt NPs are crystalline and show four distinct diffraction peaks at 39.9, 46.2, 67.3 and 82.1°, which could be assigned to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of face-centered cubic Pt NPs, respectively. The XRD data were in good agreement with the results of Dasdelen et al. [36] and Karatepe et al. (2016) [37]. On the other hand, the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was used to determine the in-depth morphology and size of synthesized Pt NPs. The images showed the presence of cubes and spherical structures, which are in good agreement with the TEM results (Fig. 3).
