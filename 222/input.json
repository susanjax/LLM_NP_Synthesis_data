Synthesis of ZnONPs
The endophytic fungus FCBGr grown in a MM (Minimal medium) containing suitable C (Carbon: 1% Dextrose) & N (Nitrogen: 1% Ammonium sulphate) source and incubated for 72 h, followed by the separation of extracellular culture filtrate by centrifugation at room temperature. ZnNO3 (0.1 mM) was added to the separated culture filtrate (pH 7.2), and the flasks were kept in a shaker for 36 h. After 36 h, the culture solution was observed for visible coalescent white cluster precipitate at the bottom of the flask, which indicates the formation of ZnONPs. The precipitate was separated by filtration, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min, washed, dried at 400 Â°C in a muffle furnace, and used for further studies. The synthesized ZnONPs were analyzed for the solubility in Polar and non-polar solvents such as water, ethanol, ethyl acetate chloroform and hexane.
Characterization of ZnONPs
The SEM image of the synthesized NPs showed that the agglomerated NPs were <100 nm in size, with a single nanoparticle in the size of 57 nm (

b). The presence of moisture content and interactions between particles, such as van der Waal's forces and magnetic/electrostatic forces, might be the reasons for NP agglomeration
[30]
. The NPs appeared in hexagonal shape, similar to those reported by
[31]
. Moreover, the morphology of the NPs were as bouquet-like structures due to the reconstruction of the NP surface inside the agglomerates, and thus, there might be changes in different planes due to the change in surface charges by active biomineralization
[32]
. The morphology of the NPs was influenced by the maintenance of culture medium pH, which models the morphological structures and differences in nucleation
