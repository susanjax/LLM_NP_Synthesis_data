Synthesis of Ar-root assisted ZnO NPs
1 mM zinc nitrate was prepared and 20 mL of root extract was added to this solution under vigorous stirring. Then the solution was stirred at 80 °C for 2 h where the solution turns to pale yellow color by which synthesis of ZnO NPs can be estimated. The pale-yellow color might be originated from the phytochemicals presented in root extract which contains active constituents such as steroidal glycosides, saponins, polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids (racemosol) and vitamins etc. and most of these constituents exhibits yellow color [

]. The precipitate from the reaction solution was separated by filtration followed by the centrifugation of precipitate at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and washed thrice with double distilled water. The product was dried in hot air oven at 80 °C for 2 h Later, the dry precipitate was then annealed in tube furnace at 100 °C temperature in oxygen atmosphere for 24 h to remove any of the impurities and to attain suitable crystallinity. Finally, ZnO nanoparticles were preserved in airtight bottles in dark for further studies.
 Characterization of Ar- ZnO NPs
Fig. S2 shows the optical absorption spectra of as synthesized Ar-ZnO NPs, recorded by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV–vis 2450). The excitonic sharp absorption peak corresponding to Ar-ZnO was obtained at 351.73 nm [

]. Further the energy band gap (Eg) was obtained through αhυ = A (hυ-Eg)n, where α is the absorption coefficient, hυ represents the energy of the photon, A is the proportionality constant and varies depending on the material, and n represents the index. Therefore, the band gap value of Ar-ZnO nanoparticles obtained at 3.19 eV. XRD pattern of Ar-ZnO NPs was recorded (Cu Kα radiation, k = 0.1540 nm) with 2θ in the range of 20−80°. The obtained XRD pattern (
Fig. 1
(a)) was well matched with standard pattern JCPDS CARD NO 36-1451, which revealed hexagonal phase with wurtzite structure. XRD pattern of root extract mediated ZnO NPs exhibited the strong diffraction planes at 31.77°, 34.43°, 36.25°, 47.54°, 56.57°, 67.84°and 69.05° that corresponded to the lattice plane of (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103) and (112) directions. The diffraction planes in the XRD pattern show sharp and narrow diffraction peaks, which suggested that the synthesized nanoparticles were pure and crystalline in nature without any impurity phases. From Debye–Scherrer equation (crystallite size (d) = kλ/β cos θ; here k, λ, β and θ are shape factor, x-ray wavelength; full width at half maximum and Bragg’s angle respectively), the calculated average crystallite size was about 46 nm. In order to explore the possible functional groups involved in root mediated synthesis of ZnO NPs.
Morphological and EDAX (chemical composition) analysis has been carried out by SEM-EDX and TEM analysis. The SEM image (
Fig. 2
a) of Ar-ZnO NPs showed spherical and hexagonal shaped morphology with various sizes ranging from 35−80 nm with an average size of 45 nm. The energy dispersive spectra of Ar-ZnO NPs obtained from the SEM-EDS analysis clearly indicated that the sample prepared by green synthesis using root extract has pure ZnO phases (Fig. S3). In addition, there were carbon and oxygen components, which might be attributed to biomolecules from root extract. In order to explore exact particle size and shape of Ar-ZnO NPs, TEM analysis has been conducted. The TEM images with 50 nm and 20 nm scales (
Fig. 2
 (b & c)) showed spherical and hexagonal particles with a size range of 20−55 nm with a mean size of 40 ± 10 nm. The particle size distribution from SEM and TEM analysis has been performed, as shown in Fig. S4. However, the morphology is similar to SEM analysis. The HRTEM images showed the interplanar distance of about 0.29 nm that indicated (101) plane representing hexagonal phase of ZnO NPs (
Fig. 2
(d)). From SEM analysis, ZnO NPs agglomeration was noticed, which might be attributed to either solvent evaporation during preparation of sample or due to electrostatic interactions and Vanderwaals forces that causes self-aggregation/self-assembly of the ZnO NPs as the synthesis process has been done in aqueous medium [
