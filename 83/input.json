I.1) Synthesis of hydrophobic gold nanoparticles (Au NPs).
Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were synthesized according to some modifications of the twophase Brust method as described in previous publications[1]. All glassware was cleaned with
aqua regia, carefully rinsed with MilliQ water and dried before use. The reaction was carried
out at room temperature under ambient conditions. Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (III) (0.300 g,
0.88 mmol 99.9%, Alfa Aesar #12325) was dissolved in 25 mL of Milli-Q water, obtaining
the aqueous solution of gold precursor. Then, a solution of tetraoctylammonium bromide
(TOAB, 2.170 g, 3.9 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich #29,413-6) in 80 mL of toluene (Fluka #89682)
was prepared. Both solutions of hydrogen tetrachloroaurate and TOAB were mixed in a 250
mL separation funnel, and shaken vigorously for about 5 min. The AuCl4
-
 ions were gradually
transferred into the organic phase (tol), due to the formation of tetraoctylammonium-AuCl4
-
ion pairs. In this process, the initial colourless toluene phase turned into a deep orange colour
while the initial yellow coloured aqueous phase (aq) turned colourless.

The aqueous solution was discarded and the toluene solution was transferred to a 250 mL
round flask. A freshly prepared solution of sodium borohydride (0.334 g, 0.88 mmol, Sigma
#452882) in 25 mL of Milli-Q water was added dropwise within one minute to the vigorously
stirred solution of gold precursor in toluene. A few seconds after the addition, the color
changed from deep orange to red-violet, indicating the nucleation of gold clusters mediated by
reduction of the gold ions by sodium borohydride.

The solution was kept stirring for one hour and then was transferred to a clean 250 mL
separation funnel where the aqueous phase was discarded. Then, 25 mL of 0.01 M HCl were
added and the mixture was vigorously shaken to remove the excess of sodium borohydride. In
a second step, 25 mL of 0.01 M NaOH were added in order to remove the excess of acid.
Finally, 25 mL of Milli-Q water were added and shaken to remove the ion excess. This step
was repeated four times. The aqueous phase was discarded and the solution was transferred to
a 250 mL round bottom flask. The solution was stirred overnight to get thermodynamically
stable NPs with narrow size distribution, in a process called Ostwald ripening. After this, in
order to enhance the NPs stability an additional ligand (surfactant) exchange step was carried
out. For this purpose 10 mL (8.450 g, 41.7 mmol) of 1-dodecanethiol (Sigma #471364) was
added and the mixture was then heated at 65 °C for 3 hours under stirring. Due to the high
binding affinity of thiols to gold, dodecanethiol displaces the Br ions of the NP surface,
yielding dodecanethiol-coated Au NPs. The solution was cooled down to room temperature
and the larger agglomerates were removed by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 min. The
supernatant was collected and larger agglomerates in the bottom of the vial were discarded.
Then, methanol was added to the collected supernatant, until the solution turned cloudy. The
solution was then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. After discarding the supernatant, the
precipitate containing the Au NPs was redissolved in toluene upon vigorous shaking. Again
cold methanol was added to the NP solution until it turned cloudy and the mixture was
centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded and the precipitate
containing the purified Au NPs was redissolved in chloroform. The average diameter of the
3
inorganic core of the Au NPs was determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to
be dc = 4.6 ± 1.1 nm (Supporting Figure S1).
