Biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles with Aspergillus flavus
A stock solution of A. flavus was inoculated into a flask containing 150 ml of potato dextrose broth. Then, it was incubated at 25°C/100 rev min−1/8 days to obtain fungal biomass. After incubation, fungal biomass was filtrated using Whatman paper number 1 and kindly washed with distilled water to remove excess growth media. Cell biomass was collected and transferred to another flask containing 100 ml of sterile water to induce fungal stress and, therefore, the production of secondary metabolites such as reducing enzymes. The solution obtained was filtered again through a Whatman No. 1 filter and exposed to a solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3) (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 1 mmol l−1 pH 6·5 in v:v ratio. Then was kept at room temperature until the colour changed, indicating the biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The process was carried out by triplicate (Villamizar‐Gallardo 2016). These nanoparticles were denominated F‐NP.
Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles with Citrus latifolia tan
The silver nanoparticles were synthesized using 5 mmol l−1 silver nitrate (AgNO3) (Sigma‐Aldrich) as the precursor of the metal salt, ascorbic acid and citric acid as reducing and stabilizing agents obtained from the extract of Tahiti lime (Citrus latifolia tan). The extract was prepared by filtering the fruit juice with a Whatman filter, heated at boiling temperature for 5 min, and centrifuged at 7000 g for 15 min to remove impurities. A percentage of citric acid equal to 4·8 ± 0·4% was determined by titration with 0·095 N sodium hydroxide and 1% phenolphthalein, while 0·4 ± 0·1% of the ascorbic acid concentration was determined by titration with iodine. A 1 : 3 (vol : vol) ratio of silver salt solution and the extract was allowed to react for 5 h at 25°C to obtain pristine nanoparticles (Gonzáles et al. 2015). These nanoparticles were denominated L‐NP.
Characterization of silver nanoparticles
The characterization of the nanoparticles was carried out by UV–Vis spectroscopy in the range of 300–700 nm. As expected, an absorption band in the UV–Vis spectral region (380–430 nm) was observed due to the silver nanoparticles' surface plasmon resonance (AbdelRahim et al. 2017). The peaks at 380 and 430 nm of the fungal‐synthesized nanoparticles (F‐NP) and leave‐synthesized nanoparticles (L‐NP) indicate they have a spherical shape (Amendola et al. 2010). The presence of a 400 nm peak corresponds to silver nanoparticles less than 5 nm in diameter. In contrast, an absorption peak of 420 nm indicates that the predominant size of the silver nanoparticles is around 20 nm.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed to determine additional characteristics of silver nanoparticles. This microscopy is a frequently used technique for characterizing nanomaterials to obtain quantitative particle size, size distribution and morphology measurements. The size of nanoparticles was from 5·34 to 70 nm, and the average size was 26·06 nm. The size distribution indicated that almost 50% of the silver nanoparticles were in the 20–30 nm size range and were approximately spherical (Fig. S1).
