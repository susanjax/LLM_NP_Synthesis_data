Green synthesis of AgNPs
The Azmak plant extract was used for the green production of AgNPs. For this purpose, 32 mg of silver nitrate was placed into a beaker along with 10 mL of deionized distilled water. The mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature with a stirrer. Simultaneously, the extract was sonicated with 10 mL of deionized distilled water for 15 min at room temperature. Filtered paper was used to filtrate the resulting mixture, and the pH of the suspension was raised to 14 by adding NaOH (0.1 M). With vigorous stirring, the prepared extract solution was poured into the glass containing the silver nitrate solution and stirred at 55 °C for 75 min (Zare-Bidaki et al., 2022).
In this research, in order to investigate the formation of AgNPs and determine the effect of different parameters on the formation of these nanoparticles, surface plasmon resonance bands were analyzed to measure the size of concentrated nanoparticles using UV–Vis spectra at a wavelength of 570 nm. The color of the solution changed from dark green to dark brown because of silver surface plasmon resonance bands, which is the first sign of the formation of AgNPs. After adding the Azmak leaf extract, silver ions are transformed into AgNPs. Concentrations of 5–30 mM silver nitrate were examined, and the highest concentration of silver nitrate required to produce green AgNPs was obtained by using the plant extract. The UV–Vis spectra of the nanoparticles synthesized with different concentrations of silver nitrate are depicted in Fig. 1a. The molar ratio of the silver nitrate concentration is an important parameter in the production of AgNPs. The peaks of the UV/Vis spectra relative to each silver nitrate concentration showed increased absorbance parallel to an increase in the silver nitrate concentration by up to 20 mM. However, after this concentration, the absorption decreased until the concentration reached 25 mM. The adhesion and compaction of the synthesized nanoparticles can cause a decline in absorption intensity. Therefore, 20 mM was selected as the optimal concentration because of its maximum absorption.
The crystalline nature, purity percentage, and size of the synthesized nanoparticles can be examined using XRD analysis. According to Fig. 2, no impurities were observed in the XRD spectrum, and all the peaks were related to the synthesized AgNPs, indicating the high purity of the synthesized nanoparticles consistent with the standard diffraction of silver (JCPDS 01-087-0717). The peaks at angles of 38, 43, 64, and 77 indicated in the XRD results correspond to 111, 200, 220, and 311 Bragg planes, respectively. The target sample's XRD results are in accordance with previous data (Fig. 2).
TEM analysis
Fig. 3 shows the captured TEM images. The spherical shape and uniformity of the nanoparticles formed with the plant extract are more accurately shown in these images. Based on these images, the synthesized nanoparticles had a size range of 20–45 nm, and exhibited a spherical morphology. The presence of a darkened area around the nanoparticles indicated that the effective compounds of the Azmak plant extract were placed around the nanoparticles.
