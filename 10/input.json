Synthesis of Nanoparticles.
Three types of functionalized and unfunctionalized CuO NPs were obtained from PlasmaChem GmbH (Germany). CuO NPs were synthesized by PlasmaChem by decomposition of Cu2CO3(OH)2, followed by the introduction of the surface groups via treatment with mercaptopropionic acid. Coated Ag NPs (cAg) were obtained from Laboratorios Argenol S. L. (Spain), uncoated Ag NPs (nAg) from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Ag2O NPs (Ag2O) were synthesized by us as described below.
Synthesis of silver oxide nanoparticles (Ag2O).
Analytical reagent grade (anhydrous, with purity over 99.9%) silver nitrate (5 mmol, 0.85 g) was dissolved in 50 mL of DI water and ultrasonicated for 1 min to achieve a homogeneous solution at room temperature.After the silver nitrate was totally dissolved, sodium hydroxide (10 mmol, 0.39 g) was swiftly added to the reaction mixture at ambient conditions and ultrasonicated for 2 h.The final solution was cooled down. Then the obtained blackish precipitate was filtered on the Whatman filter paper (Grade 5) and quenched twice with 50 mL of MQ water. The black residue was then dried at 70C for 12 h providing yields over 60%.

Characterization of the Nanoparticles.
The morphology and primary size of all NPs except Ag2O were characterized in our previous studies8,13,41. The characterization of NPs used in this study is shown in Table 1. CuO NPs (CuO) and CuO functionalized with amino groups (CuO–NH2) had positive zeta-potential, CuO functionalized with carboxyl groups (CuO–COOH) had negative zeta-potential. 
Ag2O NPs characterization by X-ray crystallography and Transmission electron microscopy was performed at the University of Tartu. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements were made with Cs corrected FEI Titan Themis 200 instrument. 
All tested Ag NPs had strong negative zeta-potential ranging from − 56.6 mV in the case of coated silver nanoparticles (cAg) to − 27.7 mV in the case of nanosilver (nAg).
