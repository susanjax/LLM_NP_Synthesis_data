 Preparation of ZnO/TiO2@plywood
The ZnO/TiO2@plywood was prepared by growing ZnO/TiO2 onto the surface of the plywood by hydrothermal method. At first, 100 mL Zn(NO3)2·6H2O with a concentration of 0.1 mol/L and 0.1 mol/L hexamethylenetetramine solution were measured, respectively and the mixture was stirred at 90℃ for 2 h by magnetic force. Subsequently, 0.2 M TiCl4 was added to the above mixture and continued to stir for 1 h. After centrifuge washing with ethanol, ZnO/TiO2 nanoparticle was obtained after drying and grinding at 110℃ for use.
A certain amount of ZnO/TiO2 nanoparticle was added to an ethanol solution containing 20 % KH560 under high-speed magnetic stirring. Subsequently, ultrasonic dispersion was carried out after 10 min of continuous stirring for 20 min (40 KHz, 300 W) to obtain ZnO/TiO2 dispersions of different concentrations. Finally, the plywood samples were impregnated with different concentrations (5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %) of ZnO/TiO2 dispersions under ultrasonication (300 W) for 60 min, and then vacuum-dried at 40℃ for 2 h to obtain ZnO/TiO2@plywood. The as-fabricated ZnO/TiO2@plywood samples were noted as ZTP1, ZTP2, ZTP3, ZTP4, and ZTP5, respectively. Furthermore, the untreated samples were labeled as ZTP0.

  Micromorphology
The specific fabrication process of ZnO/TiO2@plywood is depicted in
Fig. 1
a. It can be clearly observed that there were some rods on the surface of the sample, which were the fibers of the plywood veneer. The enlarged SEM image showed that the ZnO nanorod array layer was covered with a dense and uniform layer. Furthermore, the SEM images showed that ZnO nanorods with a length of 1 µm and a diameter of 80 nm were arranged vertically on the cellulose surface of the plywood. Moreover, these ZnO nanorods showed the same orientation directly on the surface of the plywood. In addition, it was observed that the ZnO/TiO2@plywood surface appears to be covered by continuous TiO2-modified ZnO nanorods. The spaces between these ZnO nanorods were completely occupied by TiO2. Moreover, the morphology of these well-arranged ZnO nanorods becomes a whole structure connected by TiO2, so that the end of ZnO nanorods slightly protruded from the surface of the bulk. At the same time, the surface of these nanorods becomes much coarser than that of pure ZnO nanorods. From the above morphology analysis, it can be seen that ZnO nanorods were uniformly and orderly arranged on the surface of the plywood, and the TiO2-modified ZnO nanorods array was also completely attached to the surface of the plywood. Therefore, the ZnO/TiO2 modified plywood matrix composites can be successfully prepared by hydrothermal method.

. The XRD pattern of the untreated plywood shows that the high intensity peaks at 15° and 22° correspond to the crystal plane (1 0 1) and (0 0 2), respectively. According to JCPDS data (03–0289), these characteristic peaks were attributed to cellulose in plywood. The new strong diffraction peaks were observed in the XRD patterns of ZnO/TiO2@plywood, indicating that a new crystal structure was formed on the surface of the plywood. As can be seen from XRD patterns of ZnO/TiO2@plywood, all these diffraction peaks were attributed to wurtzite structure ZnO (JCPDS 36–1451) and anatase TiO2 (JCPDS 21–1272). Therefore, the XRD pattern showed that ZnO/TiO2 nanostructures were formed on the surface of the plywood.
