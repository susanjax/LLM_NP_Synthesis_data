Preparation of the fig extract
Fresh figs underwent cleaning and chopping. Subsequently, 20 g of the figs were cooked at 60 °C for 1 h in 100 mL of DI water, with agitation provided by a heated magnetic stirrer. After cooling, the mixture underwent double filtration using Whatman No. 41 and No. 42 filter papers to eliminate impurities. After that, 4 °C was used to store the filtered FE.
 Biosynthesis of FE_Ag NPs
Fig. 1 illustrates the synthesis of Ag NPs and the associated color changes observed during the synthesis process, initiated by combining 5 mL of freshly prepared aqueous FE with a 45 mL solution containing 0.005 M AgNO3. Initially, the combined solution exhibited a brownish or dark brown color and was stored in a dark environment. As time elapsed, the color of the solution gradually transformed, indicating the formation of Ag NPs. The color change became more pronounced when the solution was exposed to FE, confirming of the successful bio-reduction of silver ions to Ag NPs.
XRD is frequently used to look at a substance's crystallinity by exposing samples to X-rays and analyzing patterns using Bragg's equation [65]. The diffraction peaks in Fig. 3 to the pertinent planes of (111), (200), (220), and (311) revealed the XRD pattern of FE-mediated silver nanoparticles at 38.34°, 44.54°, 64.68°, and 77.59° [66,67,68]. The XRD pattern matched JCPDS No. 65–2871, supporting Ag NPs FCC structure [69].
FESEM images provide detailed insights into the size, shape, and distribution of synthesized Ag NPs, offering high-resolution, three-dimensional views of their surface morphology. They complement other techniques by revealing nanoparticle morphology, aggregation state, and interaction with sample components, enhancing overall structural characterization. The (FESEM) analysis (Fig. 8(a)) of Ag NPs synthesized using Fig extract revealed a predominantly spherical morphology with some irregular forms. FESEM analysis of irregular spherical shapes provides detailed morphology information, aiding in understanding nanoparticle formation mechanisms and optimizing synthesis conditions. ImageJ analysis (Fig. 8(b)) indicated a size range of 10 nm–90 nm, averaging 44.57 nm. Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) displayed a 53.11 % silver content, confirming biosynthesis, while the prominent 3 keV peak in the EDX spectrum (Fig. 8(c and d)) verified elemental silver. A significant percentage of organic components (O, K, and C) indicated a strong coating of bio compound on the surface layer of green synthesized Ag NPs [84,85]. Hence, it is clearly understood that fig extract is acted not only for a reducing agent but also a strong capping agent during the synthesis method.
