Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
To make a silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution, AgNO3 powder which was purchased from Emsure (Macedonia) was weighed and dissolved in deionised water. 90 ml of 1 mM, 5 mM and 10 mM of AgNO3 solution was poured into three different beakers covered with aluminium foil to avoid photo-oxidation. Then, 10 mL of M. porteri ethanolic extract was added into each of the beakers and stirred continuously for 24 h at room temperature. The change in the colour of the solution indicated the formation of AgNPs [21]. The solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C by High-Speed Centrifuge Supra 22K (Hanil Science Industrial, Incheon, South Korea) to obtain AgNPs [26]. The resulting pellet was rinsed with deionised water and dried in the oven at 40 °C.
SEM analysis
Fig. 6 shows the image of MP-AgNPs under electron microscopy. The MP-AgNPs formed were well dispersed and round in shape. The measured size of one of the nanoparticles was 93.04 nm, indicating that the size of synthesised MP-AgNPs falls within the desired size range of nanoparticles which is 1–100 nm in diameter [5]. Even though SEM is beneficial for morphological and size analysis, it has limited application since it is unable to analyze the particle size distribution [23].
