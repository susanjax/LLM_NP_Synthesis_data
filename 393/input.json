Synthesis of SNPs
The amount of distilled water and leaf that yields the highest concentration of the extract is around 100 ml of distilled water and 5 g of leaf. As a result, various concentrations of silver nitrate solution (AgNO3) are added to a predetermined volume of the leaf extract (1 ml). As a consequence, it was established that the 1 ml extract volume and 1 mM AgNO3 solution concentration were optimum. 1 ml of the extract is slowly added to 2–5 ml of a 1 mM AgNO3 solution (Fig.S1). Four SNP samples were produced when the mixture was stirred by a magnetic stirrer machine for a predetermined 20 min for each mixture, with only one mixture from each being churned with a time interval fluctuation of roughly 1–120 min. When the colorless AgNO3 solution was stirred, it turned a dark brown hue, indicating the formation of SNPs. AgNO3 was dissolved in water to a concentration of 1 mM, and this solution was utilized to create SNPs (Fig.S1). It was properly mixing 0.042 g of AgNO3 with 250 ml of distilled water in this instance. To 45 ml of the 0.1 M AgNO3 solution illustrated in Fig.S2 for the bio-reduction process at room temperature, 5 ml of N. sativa L. seed extract was added.

SEM was used to examine the morphology of SNPs created via the biological process known as green synthesis (Ghotekar et al., 2020). N. sativa L. (seed) has a remarkable capacity for synthesizing SNPs that are nearly spherical in shape and are consistently dispersed, according to SEM analysis (Fig. 2A). The result of accelerating voltage was 20 KV that was used in the electron beam. The standard value is 2–20 KV, which indicates the formation of 50–60 nm SNPs. It was denoted as a working distance of 9 nm. A secondary electron was used as an electron beam.
