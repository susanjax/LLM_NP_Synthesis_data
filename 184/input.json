Preparation of pure and Co doped CuO nanoparticles
A suitable amount of Cu(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 30 ml leaf extract and stirred for 15 min in a typical synthesis of CuO nanoparticles. 2 M NaOH is prepared and added drop by drop to the solution under ceaseless stirring to maintain the pH at 10. The colour of the solution gradually changed from blue to green and then to dark brown. The solution was homogenized for 3 h by constant stirring using a magnetic stirrer. Subsequently, the colloidal solution was washed with double distilled water, centrifuged and filtered so that the polluting influences were removed from the material. Thereafter, the collected nanoparticles were dried in a hot air oven at 100 ℃ for 1 h and placed in a muffle furnace for 500 ℃ for 2 h to attain purity. This yielded fine black powder, and the obtained product was stored in an airtight container for further characterization and applications.

 represents the schematic illustration of biosynthesized CuO nanoparticles.
For the synthesis of 3 %, 5 % and 7 % Co doped CuO nanoparticles, an appropriate amount of Cu(NO3)2·6H2O and Co(NO3)2·6H2O were added to 30 ml of leaf extract and stirred for 15 min. Following that, 2 M NaOH solution is prepared and drop wise added to the reaction mixture to maintain pH 10, because pH has major influence on the size, shape and purity of nanoparticles. Then the reaction mixture was stirred, washed, centrifuged, filtered, dried and stored as discussed above.

Characterization
Fig. 2
 depicts the XRD analysis of the crystal structure and crystallite size of synthesised CuO nanoparticles with various Co concentrations. The diffraction pattern observed at the intensity peaks positions corresponds to (1 1 0), (0 0 2), (1 1 1), (
 0 2), (0 2 0), (2 0 2), (
 1 3), (
 1 1) and (1 1 3) crystallographic planes reveals a monoclinic crystal structure of CuO with a polycrystalline nature that has been well matched with JCPDS card No.48–1548 
[24]
. The sharp and intense diffraction peaks indicate the nanoparticles were well crystallized for different Co doping concentrations 
[25]
. There is no definite change in peaks position and no other extra peaks of Co related phases were observed, indicating that the replacement of Co ions fails to alter the monoclinic structure of CuO, which signifies the samples have high purity and crystalline nature 
[26]
. This suggests Co ions are effectively substituted into Cu sites within the CuO lattice without affecting the crystal structure of the parent material
[27]
. Co substitution at the Cu site has no effect on the crystal structure of CuO because the ionic radius of Co2+ (0.72Å) ions is close to the ionic radius of Cu2+ (0.73Å) ions, allowing Co2+ ions to easily substitute at Cu2+ sites within the CuO crystal lattice 
[14]
. The average crystallite size of pure and Co doped CuO nanoparticles was calculated using the Debye-Scherrer formula

where β is the full width at half maximum, θ is the diffraction angle, λ is the X-ray wavelength (1.5405 Å), D is the crystallite size and k is the crystallite shape factor. The obtained crystallite size of pure, 3 %, 5 % and 7 % Co doped CuO nanoparticles are 30 nm, 28 nm, 26 nm and 25 nm respectively. The change in crystalline size was mainly due to the distortion in the host lattice of CuO by the dopant ions, which leads to decrease in nucleation and inhibit the growth of CuO nanoparticles. The dislocation density (δ) was related to the number of defects in the grown crystalline nanopowder and the dislocation density was calculated by the relation

Fig. 5
a shows a TEM micrograph of CuO nanoparticles with a spherical shape. While the cobalt doping concentration increases, the spherical shape changes into quasi-spherical indicating a direct interconnection of CuO and cobalt (
Fig. 5
d) 
[39]
. The inter-planar space values measured from HRTEM image were 0.23 nm and 0.25 nm, which are well matched with (1 1 1) diffraction plane for pure (
Fig. 5
b) and Co doped CuO nanoparticles (
Fig. 5
e). The SAED pattern reveals of synthesized CuO nanoparticles are assigned to be the diffraction rings of (0 0 2), (1 1 1) and (
 0 2) respectively indicating the polycrystalline nature of biosynthesized CuO (
Fig. 5
c) and Cu0.93Co0.07O (
Fig. 5
d) nanoparticles. Hence, the crystallographic studies obtained from SAED were in good agreement with the observed XRD results, which prove the monoclinic structure of CuO nanoparticles.

The SEM micrograph in 
Fig. 6
a shows CuO nanoparticles have spherical shape 
[40]
. While the Co doping concentration increases, the spherical nanoparticles get agglomerated and spread on the surface, as shown in 
Fig. 6
b 
[41]
. The particle size of CuO and Cu0.93Co0.07O nanoparticles obtained from XRD are 30 nm and 25 nm, respectively. Also, their morphology shows no considerable difference. Thus, there is no chance for a remarkable difference in either particle size or morphology for Cu0.97Co0.03O and Cu0.95Co0.05O nanoparticles. 
Fig. 6
c shows EDX spectra of CuO nanoparticles containing Cu (48.46 %) and O (51.54 %) elements. Whereas, 
Fig. 6
d shows the Co doping samples were composed only Co (0.54 %), Cu (31.24 %) and O (68.22 %) elements. Thus, the fabricated samples only contain desirable element peaks and do not include any undesired elements, which confirms the sample had been doped with required element. No other signal was observed within the detection limit of EDX spectra, which indicates the purity of synthesised nanopowder. Also, the sharp and intense peak in the EDX spectra confirmed the nanoparticles’ crystalline nature and corroborated the conclusions based on the XRD results.
