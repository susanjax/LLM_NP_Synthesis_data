 Synthesis of 5-bromoindole-capped zinc oxide NPs
Zinc oxide (ZnO) was synthesized using microwave-assisted method with slight modification reported elsewhere (
Manoharan et al., 2021a
; 
Pajovic et al., 2015
). To reach pH 9, 10 mM Zn (NO3)2.6H2O was added to 100 mL deionized (DI) water and agitated for 10 min at 100 °C, 1M NaOH solution were added. Furhtermore solution was agitated for 2 h before being microwaved for 10 min at 950W. After cooling to ambient temperature, the solution was dialysis purified and stored at 4 °C until needed.

Simultaneously, 10 mM of indole derivative 5-bromoindole (5B) was prepared by sonication for 20 min, followed by continuous stirring until a clear dispersion formed, as described elsewhere (
Manoharan et al., 2020b
). The solution was then dialysis purified and kept at 4 °C until needed. The molar ratios of the 5B: ZnO nanoparticles were 0.5:0.5 (mM), 0.5:1 (mM), 1:1 (mM), 1:3 (mM), and 3:1. (mM). To evaluate antibacterial activity of the synthesized NPs, reference strains S. aureus ATCC 6538 and E. coli ATCC 700376 were used (Data not shown). The synthesized material with good antibacterial activity was further described and given the designation 5BZN (1:1, mM).All the experiments were conducted using 5BZN at the same molar ratio unless mentioned otherwise.
Characterization of 5BZN
Although many indoles have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities, it was decided to use 5B and modified 5B NPs (5BZN) because of their novelty, and they have not been studied against MDR. The elemental composition of the synthesized NPs was confirmed by EDX with elemental mapping. 
Fig. S1
 shows the EDX spectra with the EDX elemental maps of the synthesized 5BZN composite. The elemental mapping results exposed the presence of C, O, Cu, and N in the prepared composite (
Supplementary Fig. S1
). In addition, a random dispersion was observed from this analysis, indicating only the presence of C, O, Cu, and N with no other elements in the synthesized NPs. Therefore, the synthesized 5BZN was quite pure and well dispersed on the surface of 5B. 
Fig. 1
 shows a SEM image of the synthesized 5BZN, indicating that ZnO was mixed homogenously and incorporated into the 5B. The high magnification image of SEM revealed a rod shape and sheet-like structure in the presence of 5B and ZnO, respectively (
Fig. 1
A).

The XRD pattern of 5B, ZnO, and 5BZN is shown in 
Fig. 1
D. The XRD diffraction pattern detected in ZnO at 2θ = 31.59, 34.25, 36.12, 47.38, 56.43, 58.33, 62.65 and 67.92 were attributed to the zinc oxide crystalline phase (JCPDS Data Card No: 36–1451), indicating that the produced NPs were free of contaminants. On the other hand, the sharp peak intensity at 21.54° 2θ, indicates that 5B is crystalline (
Raj et al., 2021
), and the sharp peak of 5B disappeared in 5BZN. Overall, XRD pattern confirms the amorphorous nature of Synthesized 5BZN NPs. 
Fig. 1
E and F shows synthesized NPs size and zeta potential. The prepared NPs shows average particle size of 193.7 ± 16 nm with PdI of 0.341 ± 0.01 and zeta potential of +3.06 ± 05 mV.
