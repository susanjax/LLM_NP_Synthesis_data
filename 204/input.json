CuO-NPs coated cotton and starched cotton materials were prepared as previously described method [
36
] by treating 1.00 g of cotton or starched cotton with copper (II) acetate (0.01 mol) in presence of NaOH as base (0.02 mol) in 100 mL deionized water. The mixture was irradiated using Ultrasonicator (Model US-150 Ti-horn, 20 kHz, output 10 Turning 7) for 60 min, while rotating the cotton sample at speed 250 rps to ensure that cotton or starched cotton fabrics were homogeneously coated with CuO-NPs. CuO-NPs coated cotton/starched cotton materials were then washed with three successive portions of 20 ml distilled water and then dried at 80 °C overnight. These coated materials are labeled as CuO/cotton and CuO/starched cotton (1–3 starch wt.%).

The nanocomposite CuO–Ag coated cotton was prepared as previously reported [

,
[38]
,
[39]

[40]
] by treatment of 200 mg of CuO-coated cotton with 15 ml of Ag-NPs sol (0.10 mM). The mixture was vigorously shaken for 10 min to ensure complete interaction with Ag-NPs sol. Dark brown of CuO–Ag nanocomposite coated cotton material was separated, washed with two successive portions of 20 ml distilled water to remove the unreacted Ag-NPs and dried at 70 °C under vacuum (0.1torr) for 24 h. The percentage of CuO loaded on unstarched cotton fibers is calculated from
Fig. 2
 6.8% (after 10 washing cycles), whereas the percentage of CuO–Ag increased to 15.0% assuming 100% reaction between the loaded CuO with Ag-NPs sol. The Ag-NPs sol is made simply by reduction of AgNO3 using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as reducing agent in presence of surfactant.

SEM was used to analyze the morphological analyses after CuO-NPs were deposited onto cotton fibers, and the images are shown in
Fig. 3
(a–d) [
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
]. On the surface of the cotton blank (
Fig. 3
, image a), SEM clearly revealed grooves and fibrils. In the absence of starch, the morphology of CuO-NPs coated cotton fibers revealed small agglomerates of CuO-NPs as nanowire fragments of various lengths that were well adherent to the surface of cotton fabrics (
Fig. 3
, image b) [
[11]

[13]
]. CuO-NPs coated on starched cotton have a different morphology than those coated on pristine cotton; this is most likely due to the presence of starch on the surface of cotton fabrics changing the morphology of CuO-NPs. Large agglomerates of nano fibers or flakes of CuO-NPs are well adhered to the surface of cotton fabrics (
Fig. 3
, image c). CuO–Ag nanocomposite is formed by treating CuO-NPs coated cotton fabric with Ag-NPs sol, resulting in a novel morphology of CuO–Ag particles that are totally covered the cotton textiles surface (
Fig. 3
, image d).

Fig. 4
 shows photographs of TEM examination of sol Ag-NPs and their CuO–Ag nanocomposite covered cotton (a & b). When Ag-NPs spheres mix with CuO-NPs to generate CuO–Ag nanocomposite, their average particle size decreases from 43 nm to 29 nm (
