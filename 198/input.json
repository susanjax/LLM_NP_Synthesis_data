Green synthesis of AuNPs
AuNPs were formed in a 100 ml beaker by heating 50 ml of 1 mM gold chloride solution to 80 °C for 10 min. The solution was then agitated for 15 min at 90 °C for 400 rpm. Then, 5 ml of 10% (w/v) Andrographis paniculata leaf extract was put in a dropwise manner. The reaction solution was held at ambient temperature for 20 min. to monitor for a colour change. Afterwards, the pale-yellow colored reaction mixture was changed to wine red indicated the development of gold nanoparticles. The green synthesized AuNPs was centrifugated at 8000 rpm for 20 min and the top most fluid was drained off. The obtained precipitate was washed multiple times with milli Q water and the content was dried at 50 °C in hot air oven (

).


XRD pattern of the A. paniculata mediated gold nanoparticles, which was crystalline in nature and an intense peak proved the structure of AP-AuNPs (
Fig. 1
d) to be face centered cubic (fcc) nature including 37.07◦, 44.25◦, 64.97◦, and 77.80◦ (111, 200, 220 and 311 respectively) and the obtained data was compared with JCPDS file (No. 00–004-0784). The TEM image of AP-AuNPs synthesized is represented in 
Fig. 1
e. It revealed that the AuNPs is well dispersed with the leaf extract which was acting as the crowning agent to discrete the AuNPs from accumulation. The size of the AuNPs was ranged from 10 to 50 nm and most of them were sphere shaped, few were hexangular and trilateral in shape.

Dynamic light scattering is a standardized particle size analyzer detects an average size of AP-AuNPs was 40 nm by a standard deviation of 18.6 nm (
Fig. 1
f). The z- average of gold nanoparticle was 31.3 nm in the synthesis process with a poly dispersity index of 0.250. The zeta potential of the AP-AuNPs was −51.1 mV (
