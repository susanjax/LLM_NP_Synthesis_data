 Preparation of leaf extract
Copper nitrate (CuN2O6·3H2O), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was purchased from Organic Trading (Pvt) Ltd (Colombo, Sri Lanka). The Salacia reticulata leaves were obtained from department of agriculture, eastern university, Sri Lanka (EUSL). The Salacia reticulata leaves were washed thoroughly with distilled water and cut into small pieces. The 10 g of Salacia reticulata leaves pieces were transferred to 80 mL of distilled water and boiled for 20 min. Then, solution was filtered to obtain extract. The leaf extract was stored at 4 °C until further use.
 Green synthesis of CuO NPs
Fig. 1 shows green route CuO NPs preparation. In brief, 3 mL of leaf extract was added to 40 mL of aqueous copper nitrate solution (1 mM) in a 250 mL flask. This solution was incubated for 24 h at 4 0C. A change in color from blue to green suggested the formation of colloidal suspension of CuO NPs. Colloidal suspension was further dried at 120 °C for 2 h to get the CuO NPs powder.
 Chemical synthesis of CuO NPs
Fig. 2 represents chemical route of CuO NPs synthesis. The initial precursors were copper nitrate, NaOH, and PVP. Briefly, PVP and copper nitrate (0.1 M) was dissolved in 50 mL distilled water. Then, aqueous solution of NaOH (0.5 M) added dropwise to above solution and stirred for 30 min to complete the precipitation process. Precipitate was washed several times and dried at 120 °C for 2 h. Finally, precipitate was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h to get powder of CuO NPs.
XRD spectra of CuO NPs (green and chemical) is presented in Fig. 3. The estimated particle size for CuONPs (chemical) was around 84 nm, while CuONPs (green) size was around 42.2 nm. Sharp peaks indicating the crystalline nature of both prepared samples. The XRD patterns of NPs produced chemically and biologically match the reference patterns for CuO NPs in the available literature (Premana and Yulizar, 2017; Nagabhushana et al., 2016). XRD spectra illustrates that the strength and quality of XRD peaks vary based on the methods of preparation (green vs. chemical).
