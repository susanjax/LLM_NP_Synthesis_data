 Green synthesis of TiO2 NPs
TiO2 NPs were synthesized using A. indica and M. indica leaf extracts, following previously reported procedures with slight modifications.46 The leaf extracts act as both the capping and reducing agents, while TTIP served as the precursor for producing TiO2 NPs. Firstly, 4 ml of TTIP was dissolved in 50 ml of leaf extract, stirred and heated for 2 hours at 80 °C. During the reaction, the colour change was observed from a light green and white solidified precursor to an orange colour over time. The particles were observed to be mixed and dissolved completely in the extract for 2 hours. After that the resulting slurry was collected in Petri dishes and dried overnight at 60 °C. The dried powder was then crushed with a mortar and pestle and annealed in a furnace at 400 °C for 2 hours, which transformed the orange-coloured powder to white powder. The resulting TiO2 NPs were used for further experiments without further modification.

The fine-scale topological features of the samples were evaluated using SEM analysis. The SEM micrographs in Fig. 2(a) and (b) depict the slightly agglomerated spherical-like morphology of the NPs synthesized using A. indica and M. indica plant extracts, respectively. The agglomeration was observed throughout the region of NPs synthesized using M. indica (Fig. 2(a)), whereas less agglomeration was noticed in NPs synthesized using A. indica (Fig. 2(b)). These variations may be attributed to several factors: (i) the presence of different phytochemicals such as polyphenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, and alkaloids in both the plant extracts, leading to various interactions with metal precursors and affecting the nucleation and growth of NPs, (ii) the different compounds within the extracts possessing diverse abilities to reduce metal ions and stabilize NPs, resulting in size variation, and (iii) the variation in the types and nature of antioxidants present in the plant extracts, which can influence the reduction reaction of the metal precursor during NP synthesis.73 Further insights into the morphology were obtained through TEM analysis (Fig. 2(c) and (d)). The bright field TEM images of both the samples revealed agglomeration in the NPs synthesized using M. indica (Fig. 2(c)), whereas the NPs synthesized using A. indica (Fig. 2(d)) showed less agglomeration, which is consistent with the SEM analysis. This suggests that the NPs synthesized using A. indica act as a better capping agent compared to M. indica. The particle sizes of the NPs were determined through fitting the particle size distribution plot, revealing size ranges of approximately 8–28 nm for those produced using M. indica and 3–27 nm for those produced using A. indica (Fig. S1, ESI†).67 Notably, the majority of NPs in both cases exhibited a median size of 20 nm. The average particle sizes of NPs synthesized using M. indica and A. indica were measured as 18.9 nm and 19.6 nm, respectively. Moreover, Fig. 2(e) presents the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the TiO2 NPs synthesized using M. indica. The image reveals a distinct lattice spacing of 0.237 nm, corresponding to the (004) plane of the anatase phase. Furthermore, the polycrystalline nature of the sample is evident in Fig. 2(f), where multiple bright fringes are observed. Notably, lattice planes, specifically (101) and (004), are clearly identifiable in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. The elemental composition of Ti and O in NPs prepared using A. indica and M. indica plant extracts were confirmed using EDX, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†).
