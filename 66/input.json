Synthesis of Iron oxide nanoparticles
For preparing iron oxide nanoparticles, the technique of co-precipitation was used as reported in the literatures [25, 26]. The raw materials used in this technique include ferric chloride (FeCl3), ferrous chloride (FeCl2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) which were obtained from Merck Specialities, India. 30 ml of Ferrous Chloride (0.2 M) and ferric chloride (0.3 M) was mixed in a 200 ml beaker. With continuous stirring, 1.5 M NaOH was added to bring the pH of the solution 12. The stirring was continued at 700 rpm to complete the reaction. The precipitate was separated from the solution by centrifuging it at 10 000 rpm for 10 min. The product was washed and then allowed to dry in a hot air oven overnight. The resulting product was calcined at 400 °C for 4 h. The dried powder was collected and characterized.

2.2. Synthesis of Gentamicin loaded iron oxide nanoparticles
The preparation of Gentamicin loaded nanoparticles was done by the method described by Palanikumar et al [27] with slight modifications. A solution of 5 gm Gentamicin in 50 ml water was added slowly to the mixture of ferrous and ferric chloride solution (in 2:3 ratios) and the resulting solution were stirred continuously for 30 min. Sodium hydroxide in 25 ml water was introduced in the solution which resulted in the appearance of a black precipitate. The precipitate was washed twice with distilled water. It was dried in a hot air oven at 100 °C for 8 h.

Figure 1 shows the HR-TEM image of nanoparticles. For obtaining a size distribution of the nanoparticles, a frequency histogram is plotted which is shown in figure 2. From the HRTEM results, it was concluded that the average diameter of the uncoated particles is 14.21 nm and that of coated particles is 10.76 nm. The shrinkage in the size in the drug loaded nanoparticles may be attributed to the lattice strain generated due to the large Gentamicin sulfate molecules, which have inhibited the nucleation and growth of the iron oxide nanoparticles during the reaction. The HRTEM is operated in SAED mode to obtain the images which is shown in figure 3.
he SAED image for uncoated particles show prominent rings with the appearance of bright spots embedded in the rings which implies the polycrystalline nature of the particles with lattice constant of 7.94 Ǻ. The absence of any prominent ring in figure 3(b) indicates high crystallinity of the particles with a spherical shape with lattice constant of 5.93 Ǻ.
he XRD spectra of both the particles are shown in figure 5. The diffraction peaks for raw iron oxide corresponds to 2θ  =  30° (2 2 0), 35° (3 1 1), 43° (4 0 0), 57° (5 1 1), 63° (4 4 0) and 74° (5 3 3) were observed in the image. These are in coherence with the standard JCPDS 19-0629 pattern characteristics of magnetite cubic inverse spinel structure. The sample XRD indicates the ultra-fine nature and small crystallite size of the particles. The average crystallite size of the uncoated nanoparticles obtained from the XRD spectra using Scherrer Calculator came out to be 14.95 nm and that of Gentamicin coated particles came out to be 10.37 nm which is in coherence with the HR-TEM results
