2.2. Preparation and characterization of colloidal chi-AgNPs
Colloidal chi-AgNPs were prepared following a previous study ( Adlim, 2006a ) with some modifications. It was prepared by dissolving 0.600 g of chitosan in 100 mL of 1.5% (v/v) aqueous acetic acid under magnetic stirring at room temperature. Then 20 mL of chitosan solution was diluted with the addition of 20 mL of methanol. AgNO3 crystal (0.1800 g) was weighed in a weighting-boat, and then it was transferred slowly into a 100 mL three-neck-round bottom flask under magnetic stirring. The weighting boat was rinsed with a few drops of distilled water. During AgNO3 dissolution, the flask was wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid direct contact with sunlight. The round flask was connected with a thermometer, rubber stopper, and a Liebig condenser and placed within a water bath. A Tungsten lamp (40 W) was placed 5 cm distance from the solution, and it was turned on to irradiate the solution for 90 min. The temperature solution might rise ∼40 °C in a water bath. Two milliliters of the solution were sampled to follow the color change from colorless to brown, indicating the formation of AgNPs. The absorbance of chi-AgNPs colloidal was recorded by using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer at 400–700 nm.

2.3. Coating and characterization of chitosan-coated white-silica-gel beads (chi-SiG)
Coating procedure was prepared according to a previously described protocol ( Adlim et al., 2021 ) with some modifications. White-silica-gel beads (28.8660 g) were soaked within 50 mL of chitosan solution (as prepared in Section 2.2) for 60 min at room temperature, then it was dried into the oven for 60 min at 40 °C (called the first coating) and denoted as chi-SiG. Next, the chi-SiG was soaked again within 50 mL of chitosan solution for 60 min at room temperature and dried into an oven for 60 min at 40 °C (as the second coating), then it was repeated until the third coating. The drying process was carried out until a constant weight was attained. Each step of the coating was characterized by using binocular microscope stereo and SEM. The three-time coated chi-SiG was then used further in the following experiments.

2.4. Immobilization and characterization of AgNPs on chi-SiG to form AgNPs-[chi-SiG]
Immobilizing AgNPs on chi-SiG followed a previous study (
Hidayat et al., 2021
). The chitosan layer on chi-SiG was used as the template and stabilizer for AgNPs in the immobilization process. The chi-SiG (28.866 g ∼ 902 granules) was placed into a 100 mL round flask, then 20 mL of methanol containing 0.18 g of AgNO3 was added. Methanol containing AgNO3 was covered with aluminum foil to avoid sunlight contact. The flask was set in a rotary evaporator and rotated at 200 rpm, equipped with a water bath without heating. While rotating, the Tungsten lamp (40 W, at 5 cm distance from the round flask) irradiated the round flask for 90 min, and the temperature was maintained at ∼ 40 °C. The chi-SiG color changed from colorless to faintly red-brownish, indicating the formation of AgNPs on chi-SiG and was denoted as AgNPs-[chi-SiG]. AgNPs-[chi-SiG] was dried by heating until it reached the constant weight. The surface morphology of AgNPs-[chi-SiG] was characterized using a binocular microscope stereo and SEM. Then the AgNPs particle size on the surface of chi-SiG was analyzed using TEM. Five granules of AgNPs-[chi-SiG] was suspended into distilled water for 24 h, then shaken to pile off the outer film containing AgNPs. The slurry was recorded using TEM according to the previous method (
Adlim et al., 2004
).

characterization of colloidal chi-AgNPs
However, these typical chi-AgNPs colloidal absorbance spectra were consistent with the literature (
Matsumoto et al., 2006
,
Ifuku et al., 2015
). The consequent color changes were observed from colorless to brown, indicating the production of AgNPs during the reaction (
Zielinska et al., 2009
). The spectra were broad and shifted to a higher wavelength along with irradiation time. The maximum absorbance around 550–590 nm is comparable with the previous report, especially when the chi-AgNPs had changed to brown (
Ifuku et al., 2015
). Other findings reported the maximum spectra of chi-AgNPs were between 400 and 500 nm, which is related to the yellowish color (
Adlim, 2006
,
Adlim et al., 2021
). The chi-AgNPs brown color and broad spectra might indicate particle agglomeration, especially after one week of storage. This is consistent with an earlier report (
Adlim, 2006a
). The particle aggregation of colloidal chi-AgNPs in this current study was confirmed with TEM image, as shown in
Fig. 3
(b). TEM analysis revealed that in 70 min of synthesis time, spherical and mixed morphology (bars and rods) AgNPs within clusters were formed and showed that chi-AgNPs particles were aggregated with the mean particle size of 8.5 ± 4.1 nm (
Fig. 3
b). In some literature, the particle size of colloidal chi-AgNPs was in arrange of 4–120 nm (
Adlim, 2006
,
Chen et al., 2019
,
Zong et al., 2014
). Thus, the preparation of chi-AgNPs in the presence of methanol by visible light photo-irradiation gave colloidal AgNPs, and the particle started to aggregate after one week of storage. Rapid nucleation process of particles with a diameter of ∼2.5 nm might occur during irradiation time, then Ostwald ripening growth for bigger aggregation (∼11.5 nm) and finally dynamic coalescence of large growth particles (
Harada & Katagiri, 2010
). Due to considerable energy, the AgNPs tend to agglomerate leading to a decrease in antibacterial potential, which can be solved by loading AgNPs on a solid support (
Nie et al., 2018
) as a promising strategy for synthesis uniformly distributed functionalized AgNPs and it is described in Section 3.3. The physical properties like size, shape, and uniform distribution are vital properties that impact the antibacterial action of AgNPs. As far as shape and size are concerned, it has been found that smaller nanoparticles and well distributing are more stable and display a higher antimicrobial activity (
Li et al., 2013
).
After immersing AgNPs-[chi-SiG], the slurry was analyzed by TEM measurement, and the represented image is shown in
Fig. 8
(a). The TEM image of AgNPs of AgNPs-[chi-SiG] was different from the colloidal chi-AgNPs (
Fig. 1
a). Unlike the colloidal nanoparticles, TEM analysis revealed uniformly spherical AgNPs with fine dispersion (
Fig. 8
a) and slightly larger particles with a diameter mean of 13.18 ± 6.9 nm (
Fig. 8
b).
