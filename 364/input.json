Plant material and preparation of the extract
Following the procedure in [22] and with slight modifications, the fresh leaves of Hagenia abyssinica was washed with running tap water several times followed by distilled water to remove any dust particles on it. Then it was allowed to dry under shadow room temperature for 20 days to remove moisture contents from the leaves. The dried leaf was powdered using an electrical grinder to get a fine powder of the sample. The extraction was carried out by taking 50 g of plant powdered leaves in a 500 mL conical flask containing 450 mL of distilled water. It was covered with aluminum foil, to prevent the effect of light on the solution. Then the mixture was Shaked using mechanical shaker for 30 min and allowed to warm at 65 °C for 1 h on a hot-plate with magnetic stirrer, then it was allowed to cool down at room temperature. Then the prepared solution was filtered by Whatman No.1 filter paper to get the clear extract solution. The filtrate was stored at 4 °C for future experiments.
Synthesis of AgNPs
Following the procedure in [27, 28] and with slight modifications, the AgNPs were successfully synthesized using 1:2 volume ratio (100 mL–200 mL) of AgNO3 to HAPLE as a reducing and capping agent, silver nitrate as a precursor. An optimized concentration of aqueous solution of AgNO3 (4 mM) was prepared in 250 mL amber volumetric flask and used for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. For the reduction of Ag+ ions, the optimized volume of HAPLE (200 mL) was mixed with optimized volume (100 mL) & concentration (4 mM) of AgNO3 solution. The synthesis of silver nanoparticles was carried out at an optimal temperature and incubation time (40 °C and 90 min) in a closed incubator. A color change from colorless to brown was observed after optimized reaction conditions and this indicated the formation of silver nanoparticles. The reduction of Ag+ was confirmed by the UV–Vis spectrum of the reaction solution. Finally, the silver nanoparticles were separated out from the mixture by high-speed centrifugation at 10,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 20 min. After centrifugation the synthesized AgNPs pellets were rinsed with 20 mL distilled water, freeze-dried by Lyophilizer, and stored at room temperature for further characterizations. Effects of concentration, reaction time, volume ratio, temperature, and pH on the formation of AgNPs were investigated. The study was monitored using double beam UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Agilent technologies, Cary 60 UV-Vis; USA). The experiment was carried out by optimizing the concentrations of AgNO3 solution (0.5 mM, 1 mM, 2 mM, 4 mM, and 6 mM); reaction time (10 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min); volume ratio with respect to AgNO3 to plant leaf extract (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4); temperature of the reaction mixture (25 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, and 80 °C); and effects of pH (pH 4, pH 6, pH 7, pH 8, and pH 9).
XRD pattern analysis
Figure 9 shows an XRD pattern for the prepared AgNPs using HAPLE. The XRD analysis was performed to evaluate the crystalline structure, size, and purity of the prepared AgNPs. In the XRD pattern, five prominent diffraction peaks were observed at 2θ = 38.08°, 44.29°, 64.43°, 77.30°, and 81.58° which could be attributed to (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) diffraction planes, respectively. All the diffraction peaks were attributed from the cubic structure of pure Bragg's reflections of the face-centered cubic (FCC) structure of metallic silver powder phase [47]. These planes confirmed the crystalline nature of the green synthesized AgNPs. The highest peak intensity of (111) plane with narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) illustrates the good crystalline nature of synthesized AgNPs as observed from the XRD patterns. The resulted peaks and their corresponding Bragg's reflections are strongly agreed with the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS, file no. 04–0783). The prominent characteristic peaks of the green synthesized silver nanoparticles indicate the purity of the synthesized nanoparticles without any additional diffraction peaks. The average crystallite sizes of the particles were calculated by using Debye-Scherrer's equation (Equation 2):
where, D is the estimated crystal size in nanometere (nm) from XRD patterns, θ is the Bragg angle in radians, λ is the wavelength of X-ray source used (CuKα = 1.5406 Ǻ), β is the angular width at the half maximum of the diffraction peak in radians and K is the shape factor or Scherrer constant (0.9) of Debye-Scherrer's equation. The estimated average crystalline size (D) of the synthesized silver nanoparticles is found to be 22.2 nm.
The rate of formation of AgNPs was found to be slower at lower AgNO3 concentration and hence causing weaker absorbance. In this study, a single SPR band was observed for each concentration of AgNO3 and revealing spherical shape of silver nanoparticles. Spherical nanoparticles, disks, and triangular nanoplates of silver show one, two, and more SPR peaks, respectively [38].
