Plant material processing
S. wightiana was collected from district Swat (Kalam valley), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Pakistan (Specimen number F.Khuda-32521). The plant was thoroughly washed with deionized water (DI), dried in the shade, ground into powder, and then stored in polythene bags for future use.
2.1.1. Preparation of plant extract
The method of Ahmad et al. was followed for the preparation of aqueous extract (Ahmad et al., 2017). The powdered material (50 g) was soaked in DI water (500 ml) and heated (50–55 °C) for 30 min. The extract was then stirred (400 rpm) for 1 h. followed by centrifugation (7000 rpm) for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered on Whatman No. 1 filter paper and the clear filtrate was kept at 4 °C.
Gold nanoparticles synthesis
AuNPs were synthesized using an established procedure (Alaa et al., 2018). In a typical experiment, 100 ml aqueous tetrachloroauric acid trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O) solution (2 mM) was prepared in an Erlenmeyer flask. Then 1, 2, 4, and 5 ml of extract was separately added to gold solution (10 ml; 2 mM) and stirred (350 rpm) at room temperature for at least 1 h. The procedure was carried out in a dark chamber in order to prevent photooxidation. The dark-green solution rapidly changed to ruby-red, indicating the formation of AuNPs as a result of reduction of the salt to its elemental form. The mixture was incubated (37 °C) for 24 h in order to maximise AuNPs synthesis. Reduction of gold salt to AuNPs was monitored by recording the UV–vis absorption spectrum as a function of time.
SEM and TEM images were used to determine the surface and internal morphological features of AuNPs. The SEM image (Fig. 1A) indicates the formation of heterogeneously dispersed AuNPs. TEM images (Fig. 1B, 1C, and 1D) further explore that AuNPs have variable sizes and different shapes. The common shapes observed were trigonal, cubic, hexagonal, and polygonal, with an average width of 15.96 nm and area of 152.77 nm2 (Fig. S1A & B). The formation of poly-dispersed AuNPs were due to the early & later stages of nucleation. The HRTEM study discloses the single crystalline nature of AuNPs that have a common geometry of face centered cubic structure with interlayer spacing equal to 2.3 Å (Suh et al., 1998). Furthermore, Fig. 1D reveals the formation of fivefold twisted structures which confirms the existence of decahedral shapes (Elechiguerra et al., 2006, Niu and Xu, 2011). In Fig. 1D, the particle labeled as (E) presents an image of the AuNPs with enhanced structural order.
