Ag NP biosynthesis
The biosynthesis of Ag NPs was carried out using the previously described method5. To investigate the biosynthesis of Ag NPs, all CPGBs were used. Only A. baumannii isolates produced positive results for Ag NP synthesis. The Acinetobacter baumannii isolate was first cultured in a sterile flask containing 100 ml of trypticase soy broth (TSB) medium (Oxoid). The culture flask was incubated at 35 °C on an orbital shaker (120 rpm). After 24 h, the culture was centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was mixed with a 10 mM silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA, 99.9%) (1:1, v/v) and incubated at 35 °C in the dark for one day. The TSB medium mixed with culture supernatant was used as a control (without adding AgNO3)1. After obtaining the Ag NPs, they were dried overnight at 60 °C for further characterisation and applications21.
Characterization of Ag NPs
For Ag NPs, a peak between 410 and 440 nm was observed, as is well known for metallic NPs with sizes ranging from two to 100 nm22. In our study, a single SPR peak was observed, indicating that the metal NPs were spherical in shape and parallel to the TEM images.
The Ag NPs showed some typical diffraction peaks at 2θ of about 38.037°, 44.205°, and 64.344° (labelled as Ag in Fig. 2c), corresponding to planes 111, 200, and 220, respectively. These diffraction peaks matched the cubically centred faces of the standard silver crystal (JCPDS file no.98–018-0878), as reported in37,44. 
A TEM examination was carried out to better understand the surface morphology and to obtain additional size information. Analysis of TEM images using ImageJ software revealed the presence of several monodisperse, spherical, well-separated, and relatively uniform NPs ranging in size from 1 to 9 nm and with an average size of 4.7 nm (Fig. 3c and d).
