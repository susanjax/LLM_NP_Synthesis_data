Different AgNPs, uncoated and coated, were produced through the chemical reduction of silver, by adapting a method previously developed by Dong and colleagues (Dong et al. 2012). Briefly, the uncoated AgNPs were synthesized using AgNO3 and NaBH4 (as metal precursor and reducing agent, respectively), at the required stoichiometric ratios. First, 5 mL of 0.001 M AgNO3 solution was added dropwise to 30 mL of 0.002 M NaBH4 solution, under constant stirring and at room temperature, until an AgNO3:NaBH4 molar ratio of 1:5 was achieved (Song et al. 2009). Uncoated nanoparticles (AgNP) production was confirmed by the change in the color of the solution (from colorless to yellow) and afterward samples were stirred during 30 min. For producing PVP-coated AgNPs (AgNP:PVP), 5 mL of 0.1 % solution of PVP (stabilizer agent) was added to the mixture of AgNO3 and NaBH4, prepared as described above. All procedures were performed in the dark, to prevent the photodecomposition of AgNO3.
Characterization of nanoparticles
TEM analysis (Fig. 3b) confirmed the quasi-spherical shape of AgNP:PVP, as well their high dispersion in solution, ensuring a larger surface-to-volume ratio required for NPs antimicrobial activity (Bryaskova et al. 2011; Dong et al. 2012; Rai et al. 2009). The high surface area-to-volume ratio, characteristic of AgNPs, may lead to self-attractions and consequently to particle aggregation, which was verified for the non-coated NPs produced. In this study, PVP was chosen as a protective agent, since it didn’t show any toxicity for eukaryotic cells (data not shown) and it was able to keep the particles isolated from each other, increasing their stability over time (Csempesz and Csáki 2000), which is especially critical for biomedical applications (Levard et al. 2012). Furthermore, to confirm that 1 week after synthesis, AgNP:PVP’s quasi-spherical shape, size (16 ± 7.8 nm), and dispersion in solution were preserved while AgNP’s aggregated, further TEM images were acquired (Fig. 4).
Herein, the hydrodynamic diameter of the NPs was determined through dynamic light scattering and the results revealed an average size of 36.4 ± 10.20 nm and 27.02 ± 1.3 nm for AgNP and AgNP:PVP, respectively. Such results are in agreement with the data previously reported in literature (Song et al. 2009; Zielińska et al. 2009).
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was used to characterize the atomic arrangement, crystalline or amorphous phases of NPs (Guinier 2013). It is important to know the exact nature of the silver particles and this may be deduced from the XRD spectrum of the sample. The XRD spectra (Fig. 6, spectrum b) show a characteristic peak at a scattering angle (2θ) of 38.2°. This corresponds to the reflections of the crystalline nanoparticles in the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure with (111) planes in the crystal lattice (Dong et al. 2012). Other diffraction peaks characteristic of Ag are at 2θ of 44.3, 64.5, and 77.5° that correspond to the (200), (220), and (311) sets of crystallographic planes, respectively, in the fcc structures of silver (Monteiro et al. 2009; Nguyen et al. 2012; Seoudi et al. 2011).
