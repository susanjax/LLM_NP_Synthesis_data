Synthesis of pure and Cu-doped ZnO nanorods
Chemical precursors are purchased from Sigma Aldrich (98.977 % purity). In this study Cu doped ZnO nanoparticles (0, 2.5, 5 %) were synthesized by direct hydrothermal method using Zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn (CH3COO)2·2H2O), Copper acetate monohydrate (Cu (CH3COO)2·H2O) as metal precursors and MB dye is taken for photocatalytic treatment.

ZnO nanorod was prepared hydrothermally by adding 1 M Zinc acetate in appropriate amount of deionized water. The resultant mixture is stirred well for 30 min to form a homogenous solution in which the desired amount of ammonium hydroxide is added to maintain the pH at 11. The solution was then transferred into 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and placed in the oven at 150 °C for 2hrs
[16]
. After that, the solution is filtered and washed several times with Deionised water and ethanol. The filtered powder was dried in a laboratory oven at 60 °C overnight. On the other side, Copper acetate was added to the Zinc acetate solution to the desired concentration (2.5, 5 %) for the preparation of Cu doped ZnO nanorod and followed the same procedure as above. Pure ZnO, 2.5, and 5 % Cu doped ZnO samples were respectively named as Zn, CZ1, and CZ2 for convenience.


Structural characterization of synthesized samples, determined from the XRD diffraction pattern is shown in
Fig. 2
 a. Peaks observed at 2θ values of 31.52⁰, 34.15⁰, 35.95⁰, 47.28⁰, 56.28⁰, 62.52⁰, 66.11⁰, 67.68⁰, 68.83⁰, 72.22⁰ and 76.84⁰ corresponds to the ZnO crystal planes. Major diffraction peaks of (1 0 0), (0 0 2), and (1 0 1) planes are in good agreement with the hexagonal wurtzite ZnO crystal structure (JCPDS No. 36–1451) which is the most stable ZnO phase with space group of P63mc
[13]
. Since no other peaks seem corresponding to copper, it indicates the proper substitution of Cu over the Zinc sites. The sharp diffraction peaks resemble the highly crystalline nature of the material as reported earlier
[3]
,
[5]
. To confirm the proper occupation of Cu2+ ion in the Zn2+ sites, the major peaks were selected and compared the shift (
Fig. 2
b). A very slight peak shift was observed towards lower 2
 values with Cu doping compared to pure ZnO. The shift may arise due to the Cu2+ (0.057 nm) substitution on Zn2+(0.06 nm) sites
[14]
,
[15]
. Thus, it confirms the doping of Cu in ZnO crystal lattice

By Modified Scherrer equation, the crystalline size of the samples can be found by taking all the intense peaks. The average crystalline size is calculated from the equation as follows
[17]
:
(1)

Where the terms D corresponds to the average crystalline size in nm,
 is the wavelength of Xray (1.5141Å),
 is the Braggs angle in degrees, and
 full width at half maximum (FWHM) in radians. Linear square method is applied after plotting
 against ln (1/
). Crystalline size can be extracted from the values of slope and intercept with the straight-line equation in which the y intercept is equal to ln (k
. The average crystalline size of the prepared pristine and Cu-doped ZnO samples are found to be in the range of 31–25 nm. The value of average crystalline size and corresponding strain were tabulated in
Table 1
. It is noted that the variation in crystalline size of ZnO nanoparticles with Cu doping is not monotonic. CZ1 shows a crystalline size smaller than pure ZnO and for CZ2 the crystalline size is large compared to CZ1 and smaller than ZnO. The decrease in crystalline size may be due to Cu2+ addition which decreases the nucleation and growth rate. The existence of Cu2+ ions in the ZnO lattice restricted the crystal grain size increment
[4]
,
[15]
. Thus, we can say that existence of a small amount of transition metal on the metal oxide has a significant effect on the crystalline size of the sample.
