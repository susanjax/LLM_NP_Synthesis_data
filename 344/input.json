Preparation of ZnO NPs
The zinc nitrate solution (0.2 M) was prepared in deionized water. Now, the zinc nitrate solution was mixed with E. Japonica leaf extract (2:4 ratio) in 250 mL conical flask. The mixture is heated with constant stirring for 10 min at 60 ℃. The pH level of the mixture was adjusted using NaOH (2 M) until pH reached to 12 and stirred for 150 min (Conter checked it is ok). The obtained precipitates were separated by centrifuging at 5000 rpm, which was washed with water and ethanol many times. The synthesized NPs were kept at 60 ℃ in an oven overnight for drying. For characterization and PCA, the NPs were calcined at 300 0C for 2 h and for biological activity, the NPs were dried at 80 0C for 2 h.
Morphology and elemental composition
The morphology of ZnO NPs synthesized via green route was examined by SEM analysis. SEM gave the evidence of surface characteristics of NPs and any interaction between ZnO NPs and bioactive agents. The response of SEM analysis is depicted in Fig. 5. The ZnO particles was in the form of platelets and irregular in shape. Moreover, the ZnO NPs were in aggregates form, which is due to the interface among biomolecules caping and stabilizing the NPs. Elemental analysis of the prepared ZnO NPs was also performed for the assessment of purity and composition of the prepared ZnO NPs and response is depicted Fig. 6. The oxygen and zinc were detected in the prepared sample with 19.87 and 74.95 (%) ratio, which indicates that ZnO NPs are highly pure.
The size and crystallinity of the ZnO NPs was determined by XRD analysis and responses thus observed are presented in Fig. 7. The ZnO NP was face centered cubic (FCC) crystals with (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3) and (1 1 2) planes, which is in line with the standard (JCPDS # 36–1451) (Jamdagni et al., 2018). The Scherer formula was employed to approximate the particles size of ZnO NPs.

where k is constant having value 0.9, λ (0.15406 nm) is the wavelength of x-ray, β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) value in radians and θ is the half of the diffraction angle of the middle of the peak in radians. By using the Scherrer equation, the ZnO NPs size was found to be 13 ± 4.2 nm. These conclusions are harmonized with previous reports, which utilized green routes (using plant extracts) for the preparation of ZnO NPs at nano-scale having different shapes, i.e., Z. jujube fruit extract are utilized for the successful fabrication of ZnO NPs, which furnished 21–37 nm and spherical shaped NPs (Golmohammadi et al., 2020). Similarly, Z. nummularia leaves extract furnished ZnO NPs in 12.47–26.97 nm range having spherical shape (Padalia and Chanda, 2017). Also, Z. mays peel furnished 300–550 nm sizes particle with flowers like morphology (Quek et al., 2020). The ZnO NPs formation mechanism is displayed in Fig. 8. It is proposed that the Zn ions reduced to zero valent atom by reacting with electron rich compounds in the extracts. First, a Zn(OH)42− specie is formed in basic pH, which on reaction with polyphenols and flavonoids form a complex, which on calcination and decomposition furnished ZnO NPs (Chemingui et al., 2019).
