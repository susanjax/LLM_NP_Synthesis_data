Synthesis and Characterization of PtNPs
We synthesized PtNPs by reducing PtCl62− ions to PtNPs in a mixture of 10 mL of 1 mg/mL lycopene and 90 mL of 1 mM aqueous H2PtCl6∙6H2O. Mixtures were maintained for 1 h at 100 °C (using a hotplate) in sealed flasks to avoid evaporation, as increasing temperatures catalyze the reduction process. Identical amounts of platinum solution and lycopene were separately maintained under the same reaction conditions for control experiments. The reduced platinum solution was sonicated for 10 min to separate platinum nanomaterials from biomolecules, then passed through a 0.2-µm syringe filter. The reduced platinum was purified by repeated centrifugation at 5000× g for 30 min, and the pellets were washed with distilled water to remove impurities. Purified PtNPs were characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microcopy.
Characterization of PtNPs Using Lycopene
Figure 1B shows that crystalline PtNPs had the features of a Pt face-centered cubic (fcc) phase. First (111), second (200), and third (220) peaks corresponded to 2θ values of 41.9°, 46.5°, and 67.5°, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks of PtNPs were broad and comparable to those of the corresponding bulk Pt material. The average size of Pt nanocrystallites was calculated from each XRD peak using the width of reflection according to the Debye-Scherrer equation. The particle size of polyhedral and anisotropic PtNPs was analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to ensure a nanosized particle range of 5–45 nm. Over 90% of the PtNPs were polyhedral (spheres, cubes, rectangles, triangles, octahedrons, and tetrahedral or truncated cubic hexagons, octahedrons and tetrahedrons) with very sharp corners, edges, and facets.
The average size of synthesized PtNPs measured as dynamic light scattering was 30 (range, 10–100) nm, which was slightly larger than that determined by TEM due to Brownian motion of the suspended particles (Figure 1D). The mean hydrodynamic diameter of PtNPs was 25.5 ± 5 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.150 ± 0.015.
