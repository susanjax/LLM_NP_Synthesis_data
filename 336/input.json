Biosynthesis of GASM-AuNP, GASM-AgNPs, and GASM-Ag-AuNCs
GASM is used as a reducing agent in the biosynthesis of GASM-AuNPs, GASM-AgNPs, and GASM-Ag-AuNCs. The optimal conditions for the formation of nanoparticles and nanocomposites were determined by testing a variety of temperatures, incubation times, volumes, and concentrations. Biosynthesis of GASM-AuNP, GASM-AgNPs, and GASM-Ag-AuNCs were determined by varying the concentrations of HAuCl4 (0.0001–0.1 mM), AgNO3 (0.01–0.3 mM), temperatures (10 °C- 70 °C), and contact times (1–15 min).
The optimal conditions for this biosynthesis were determined by varying the concentrations of HAuCl4 (0.0001–0.1 mM), AgNO3 (0.01–0.3 mM), temperatures (10 °C- 70 °C), and contact times (1–15 min). Temperature increased the mobility, oxidation, and reduction of silver and gold ions in the extract [13]. Based on this initial analysis, the GASM-AuNPs were biosynthesized by adding 15 mL of 0.1 mM GASM extract to 35 mL deionized water, and stirring them with 0.5 mL of 0.01 mM HAuCl4 at 45 °C for 6 min. The GASM-AgNPs were synthesized by adding 8 mL of GASM extract to 40 mL deionized water and mixing them with 1 mL of 0.1 mM AgNO3 at 50 °C for 7 min in a water bath. The GASM-Ag-AuNCs were synthesized by mixing 10 mL of 0.1 mM GASM extract with 40 mL deionized water, and mixing it with 1 mL of 0.1 mM AgNO3 and 0.5 mL of 0.01 mM HAuCl4 at 55 °C for 10 min in a water bath. Fig. 2 shows the preparation and characterization of GASM-AuNPs, GASM-AgNPs, and GASM-Ag-AuNCs.
The morphology, size, and structure of nanoparticles and nanocomposites were evaluated using FESEM, EDS, and TEM. A FESEM image of surface morphology (Fig. 7.A -C), TEM image of validated formation (Fig. 8.A -C), and EDS image of elemental composition (Fig. 9.A -C) confirmed the biosynthesis of nanoparticles and nanocomposites. The GASM-AgNPs and GASM-AuNPs were spherical and averaged 45 nm and 50 nm in size. In the GASM-Ag-AuNCs, the mean size was 7 nm. A high concentration of ascorbic acid in GASM confirmed the particle size of the particles.
