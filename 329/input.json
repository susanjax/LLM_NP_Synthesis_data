Synthesis of tobramycin-chitosan nanoparticles
A modified ionic gelation method developed in our lab was used to prepare four tobramycin-chitosan nanoparticles (TOB-CS NPs) (Al-Nemrawi et al., 2018a). An aqueous solution, referred to as Phase 1, was prepared by dissolving CS and TOB in 40 mL of a 0.2% acetic acid solution. The solution pH was adjusted to 5.0 ± 0.05 using sodium hydroxide and the solution was stirred overnight. Then, filtered through a 0.45 µm syringe filter (Next Advance, USA), and heated to 60 °C in a water bath for 10 min.
In a different beaker, the second phase, referred to as Phase 2, was prepared by dissolving TPP in 20 mL of HPLC water. Then, the solution was filtered through a 0.45 µm syringe filter and cooled to −4°C.
Phase 2 was added to the heated Phase 1 dropwise at a rate of 1 mL/min under continuous stirring at 700 rpm. The resulting dispersion stirred and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. Then, the nanoparticles were washed twice with distilled water. Finally, the sample was freeze-dried for 24 h at −80 °C to obtain the nanoparticles.
Formula A and B were prepared to get the weight ratios of 1:2:2 and 1:5:5 of Chitosan: TOB: TPP, respectively. Formula C and D were prepared using the same procedure used to prepare Formula A and B, except that TOB was added to Phase 2 rather than to Phase 1. The weight ratio of Chitosan: TOB: TPP of formula C and D were 1:2:2 and 1:5:5, respectively. All powdered samples were kept in a tightly closed containers for future studies. Table 1 shows the components of each formulation in each phase.

Synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles
ZnO NPs were prepared by two methods: The precipitation method (ZnO2) and the solvothermal technique (ZnO1). In the precipitation method, zinc nitrate was first dissolved in deionized water and added to ammonium carbonate solution in a volume ratio of 1.5:1 to interact and give ZnO NPs that precipitate. After that, the precipitate was purified by washing with deionized water and heated for six hours in an oven at 90 °C. The obtained powder was kept in the furnace at 500 °C for four hours. Finally, the particles were freeze dried and the powdered sample was kept in a tightly closed container for future studies.
In the solvothermal technique, ethanolic solution of NAOH was dropped into another ethanolic solution of zinc acetate that was kept at 70 °C in water path. The mixture was kept at 70 °C for 1 hr, and then, the mixture was centrifuged for 3 min at 2500 rpm. The precipitate was washed by ethanol and centrifuged again at 2500 rpm several times. Finally, the particles were freeze-dried and the powdered sample was kept in a tightly closed container for future studies.

Characterization of tobramycin-chitosan nanoparticles
The PS, PDI, ZP and EE of the NPs are summarized in Table 2. Formula D exhibited the smallest size followed by formula B then formula A and finally formula C. Even though the sizes of the particles are somehow large, they still can be considered. Polymeric nanoparticle prepared using chitosan reaching 1000 nm were reported previously to be used to load antimicrobial drugs and to control their release(Abruzzo et al., 2021, Al-Nemrawi et al., 2018, Nguyen et al., 2017). The PDI values of all formulations indicate monodispersity of the samples with the best uniformity for formula D followed by formula B then formula A and finally formula C. From the results, we can notice that the amount of TPP used affects the sizes of CS NPs, where the higher the concentrations of TPP used in preparing CS NPs results in larger NPs (Jonassen et al., 2012). In this study, formula D showed the smallest size and the best uniformity. Moreover, the size of the particles of formula D is lower than the sizes of TOB-CS NPs prepared by other investigators (Vaezifar et al., 2013).

All NPs carried positive charges, which can be explained by the free amine groups of chitosan that get protonated in water. Differences in the surface charges between the formulas may be related to the extent of crosslinking between the negatively charged TPP with the positive amino groups of chitosan (Al-Nemrawi et al., 2018a).
In this study, the EE of TOB in all formulations was very high and more than 50%. The EE varied between the four formulations, but had higher values in comparison to nanoparticles prepared using the same method by other researchers (Sobhani et al., 2017). The morphology of TOB-CS NPs was investigated. All formulas showed spherical NPs as represented in Fig. 1.
