 Synthesis of Tinospora zinc oxide nanoparticles
Under ambient conditions, 1 mM ZnSO4Â·7H2O was reacted with 1 percent (m/v) stem extract of T. cordifolia made in water to produce Tinospora stem extract nanoparticles of zinc oxide (TSE-ZnO-NPs). The transition of the color changes was noted. Later, confirmation of the biosynthesis of the nanoparticle was done by UV Visible spectroscopy, FTIR spectral analysis, FESEM size analysis, and EDAX elemental content analysis of the newly produced. The solution was further dried in a rotary shaker and stored in a desiccator.
characterisation
Using FESEM, the mean size of TSE-ZnO-NPs was found to range from 43.6 nm to 87.7 nm. They appeared spherical and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed that 59.8 % Zinc was present in the biomaterial TSE-ZnO-NPs (

). Furthermore, the absence of agglomerates suggests that ZnNPs have been stabilized, possibly by the plant phytochemical Columbin.
