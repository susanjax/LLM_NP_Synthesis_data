Biosynthesis and characterization of ZrO2 NPs
The ZrO2 NPs were synthesized using CSE according to the method reported earlier with slight modifications [
9
,
14
]. The CSE (10 mg/mL) was added drop by drop to the ZrCl4 (1 mM) solution until it changed the color of the solution. The resulting mixture was kept in a magnetic stirrer at 60 °C at 120 rpm for 3–4 h. Afterward, the precipitate was obtained by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min. Then the impurities were washed with double-distilled water and dried at 60 °C in a hot air oven. For the preparation of antibiotics (ampicillin and erythromycin) loaded ZrO2 NPs, 50 mL of ZrO2 NPs (0.5 mg/mL) were mixed with 5 mL of each antibiotic (1 mg/mL) at 120 rpm for 3–4 h. The antibiotic (Amp and Ery) loaded ZrO2 NPs (ZrO2-Amp NPs and ZrO2-Ery NPs) were collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min and freeze-dried overnight.

Characterization
 XRD analysis
XRD is frequently applied for the characterization of nanoparticles to examine the distribution of internal atoms and the structure [
24
]. The crystallographic properties of ZrO2 NPs were examined by XRD (
Fig. 1
B). The main diffraction peaks of 2θ at 24.54⁰, 28.24⁰, 33.17⁰, 40.39⁰, 49.96⁰, 58.64⁰, and 70.81⁰ which were indexed to diffraction planes of (110), (111), (200), (102), (220), (311) and (400) respectively. These characteristic diffraction peaks were matched with the standard monoclinic and tetragonal structure of ZrO2 (JCPDS: 37–1484 and 42–1164) [
23
,
25
]. Additionally, there were also some unidentified peaks observed in the XRD patterns of ZrO2 NPs that might correspond to CSE. Overall, the XRD patterns revealed that ZrO2 NPs were monoclinic and tetragonal structures [
25
].

3.2.2. TEM-EDS analysis
TEM was used to examine the microstructure, distribution, and size of ZrO2 NPs [
26
]. TEM images of ZrO2 NPs at different nanoscales are shown in 
Fig. 1
. C and D. The results showed that ZrO2 NPs were irregularly spherical and sized <200 nm. These results are comparable with other green synthesized ZrO2 NPs using plant extracts [
27
]. The size and morphology of ZrO2 NPs can be varied depending on plant extracts and the ratio of zirconium salt. The presence of oxygen (O), carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and zirconium (Zr) in the ZrO2 NPs were confirmed by EDS analysis (
Fig. 1
. E). EDS spectrum showed a peak at 0.5 keV for O and at 2.2 keV for Zr, which indicated the composition of crystalline ZrO2 NPs. In addition, the EDS spectrum revealed no further spurious peaks, verifying the high purity [
20
].
The particle distribution, stability, and zeta potential of nanoparticles are essential characterization factors for the nanoparticles [
23
]. The particle size distribution and zeta potential of ZrO2 NPs were shown in
Table 1
 and SI. 
Fig. 1
. The average diameter of ZrO2 NPs was 54.67 ± 3.89 d. nm with a PDI of 0.660, and a zeta potential of −7.79 ± 1.06 mV. The negative zeta potential indicated the capping molecules from CSE. Furthermore, the average diameters size of the ZrO2-Amp NPs and ZrO2-Ery NPs were 73.99 ± 6.79 d. nm and 80.41 ± 4.62 d. nm, with a PDI of 0.363 and 0.300, and a zeta potential of −38.1 ± 3.91 mV and −13.5 ± 2.17 mV, respectively (SI. 
Fig. 1 C-
F). The size difference occurred between nanoparticles due to the loading of antibiotics. The sizes of ZrO2-Amp NPs and ZrO2-Ery NPs were found to be higher than bare ZrO2 NPs (SI. 
Fig. 1
. C and E). These results implied that the antibiotics were bound well to the nanoparticles, thereby causing size variation in the nanoparticles. The zeta potentials were significantly varied between the nanoparticles. Furthermore, the ampicillin and erythromycin exhibited a negative zeta charge of −42.3 ± 4.09 mV and −19.4 ± 3.06 mV, respectively (SI. 
Fig. 1
. G and H). The antibiotic-loaded nanoparticles exhibited a higher negative zeta charge than the ZrO2 NPs. Furthermore, the PDI<0.5 indicated the stability of the nanoparticles [
