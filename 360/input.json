Synthesis of CNDs
Carbon Nano Dots (CNDs) have been synthesized by implementing a protocol reported by Sawalha et al. [43,44] with some modifications. Briefly, Olive solid waste (OSW) was used to obtain CNDs particles, where OSW product was washed using hot boiled water. OSW product was pyrolyzed in a furnace in absence of air for 1 h at 400 °C to produce carbon-based material, and then it was milled to a fine powder. After that, 100 mg of the sample was dispersed in 10 ml of distilled water and 0.45% H2O2. After that, the mixture was sonicated by using Elmasonic S 100 H Sonicator for 10 min, subsequently followed by refluxing for 90 min, and the resultant solution was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min by a HERMLE Z 200 A Universal Compact Centrifuge. 0.22 µm micro-filter syringes were used to filter the supernatant that contains CNDs particles. The prepared CNDs solution was dialyzed through a 1 KD membrane against distilled water for 24 h to remove unreacted material or excess reagents. For further applications, CNDs solutions were lyophilized to get a light brown powder.
2.2. Synthesis of ZnO-NPS
ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized by a modified precipitation method as reported in the literature [45]. Briefly, 50 ml of 1 M of sodium hydroxide NaOH was slowly added dropwise to a 1.4 g of Zinc sulfate heptahydrate (ZnOSO4·7H2O) in isopropanol solution under continuous stirring for 12 h resulting in the formation of a white suspension. After that, the solution was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min by a HERMLE Z 200 A Universal Compact Centrifuge, washed with distilled deionized water three times by adding 50 ml each time, and centrifuged again at 4000 rpm for 10 min. Finally, the product was recovered and dried in an oven for 24 h at 100 °C until dried white-colored ZnO NPs obtained for further use.
2.3. Synthesis of hybrid ZnO–CNds
The hybridization approach of ZnO–CNDs nanocomposite was based on a procedure previously reported in the literature [8,26] with modifications as follows:
The two prepared materials; CNDs and ZnO were used in the preparation of hybrid material according to a prepared green sol–gel method in one pot reaction. A set of 50 ml round bottom flask containing ZnO (70 mg, 0.885 mmol) dispersed in 10 ml isopropanol and stirred for 15 min till dissolved. Subsequently, 9 ml of CNDs solution (1 mg/ml) was added to the flask and wrapped with aluminum foil to prevent illumination. The mixture was sonicated for 30 min at 80 °C by using Elmasonic S 100 H Sonicator. Then, the mixture was lifted stirring at room temperature overnight. The obtained precipitate was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min by a HERMLE Z 200 A Universal Compact Centrifuge, washed with 30 ml of distilled water to remove unreacted CNDs. The obtained wet pale-yellow colored powder was dried in an oven for 2 h at 60 °C. The obtained product was referred to as Hybrid for increasing the absorption in the visible light region and the influential energy conduction band leading to massive photocurrents was kept for further characterizations and application.
The morphology and size of the prepared materials; CNDs, ZnO, and hybrid were studied by AFM. As shown in Fig. 2, the CNDs nanoparticles were well dispersed having a size range of 0.84–5 nm with an average size of 2.3 ± 0.9 nm.
For ZnO nanoparticles, they show a size range of 10 to 30 nm with an average of 23.5 ± 3.2 nm. Meanwhile, hybrid materials were in the range of 40 to 180 nm, averaging 105 ± 26 nm. It is noteworthy that the average size of the hybrid is larger than ZnO and CNDs, which corresponds to two main reasons: the presence of CNDs adsorbed on the surface of ZnO particles, and an agglomeration phenomenon shows an electrostatic interaction between hybrid particles, as illustrated in AFM images (Fig. 3). The results inferred that this method has successfully prepared a nanocomposite contains both CNDs and ZnO. Moreover, the hybrid material shows good dispersion in water, forming a homogenous suspension solution.
To further confirm the combination between CNDs and ZnO nanoparticles, XRD patterns of ZnO, CNDs and hybrid crystal structures are illustrated in Fig. 4a. For the ZnO case, the XRD pattern confirms the typical hexagonal Wurtzite crystal structure, with characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ° = 32°, 34.68°, and 36.53° corresponded to (100), (002), and (101) crystal planes, respectively. Other peaks appeared at 47.87°, and 57° which are related to (102), and (110) planes respectively [52]. The CND's XRD spectrum shows a diffraction peak at 2θ° = 25.6° which corresponds to (002) graphitic plane [53]. After ZnO have been combined with CNDs, minor changes in the XRD patterns of a hybrid compared to pure ZnO are noticed, with an appearance of a new weak peak at 25.6° that is related to (002) graphitic plane originating from the amorphous CNDs, in addition to that, slight shifts in the main diffraction lines to lower degrees and an increase in full width of half maximum (FWHM) for 2θ° from 0.53° to 0.64° of (101) crystal plane have been observed, these changes would indicate the adsorption of CNDs on the ZnO lattice components [54]. Furthermore, the broadening of the (101) diffraction peak leads to a smaller crystallite size of 13.64 nm compared to 16.48 of ZnO as calculated from the Debye-Scherrer equation (Eq. (1)) for (101) of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO and ZnO–CNDs hybrid.
