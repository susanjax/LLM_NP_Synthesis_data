Synthesis of AgNPs
For the production of green-synthesized AgNPs, AgNO3 was used as a silver precursor at concentrations of 5 mM (AgNP-Aloe-1) and 9 mM (AgNP-Aloe-2). The reducing and capping agent used was an aqueous extract of Aloe maculata, where 10 ml of the extract was added to 90 ml of the AgNO3 solution. The same concentration of the extract was used in both cases. The plants used were grown without any synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, or pesticides at Raco, Tucumán Province, Argentina (Latitude 26°38'13.1"S and Longitude 65°22'53.3"W, height above sea level: 1100 meters) and harvested in March 2021. The plants were identified by Dr. Jaime from the Universidad Nacional de Tucumán, Argentina, and leaves from 3-year-old plants were collected. External leaves placed in the lower part of the plant were selected. The leaves were cut into small pieces and heated in distilled water (ratio 1:10, leaves:distilled water) at 80 °C for 10 min. The resulting yellow liquid was then filtered. For conventional AgNPs synthesis (AgNP-NH2OH·HCl), 1.11 mM of AgNO3 was used as a silver precursor, and hydroxylamine hydrochloride (NH2OH·HCl) was used as reducing agent [24,25]. Briefly, 300 μl of a 1 M NaOH solution was added to 90 ml of 0.06 M NH2OH·HCl solution, and then 10 ml of the AgNO3 solution was added dropwise to the mixture under vigorous stirring. Finally, a brown silver colloid was obtained with a final pH of 5.5, and the silver suspension was aged for 24 h. Both methods were carried out at room temperature with constant stirring until a color change, indicating the formation of nanoparticles. All solutions were prepared in purified Milli-Q water. After synthesis, all AgNPs were stored in the dark at room temperature. They were purified from the synthesis medium using centricons (Amicon® Ultra-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Devices, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with a membrane of cellulose with a molecular cutoff of 3 kDa, and were kept in Milli-Q water. Two independent batches of AgNPs were obtained using extracts from different plants harvested at the same time and compared.
 Size, shape, and colloidal stability
Based on the TEM micrographs (Fig. 5) obtained from the newly synthetized AgNPs, it was observed that AgNP-Aloe-1 and AgNP-Aloe-2 were amorphous but tended towards a spherical shape. In the case of AgNP-NH2OH·HCl, they also had a quite spherical shape. The AgNPs presented a size distribution between 10 and 25 nm.
