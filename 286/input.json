GT extraction About 30 ml water were added to 1 g dried ground GT leaves. The mixture was heated for 30 min at 50 °C under magnetic stirring, then cooled and filtered.Synthesis of GT AgNPs Different concentrations of aqueous (GT) extracts were used to prepare the AgNPs: the concentration that afforded the best stability and yield was selected. For the preparation, 10 ml silver nitrate solution (0.01 M) were added to 20% aqueous GT extract solution in a dropwise manner, and 2.5 ml NaOH (0.1 M) were added to the mixture. The resulting solution was then heated for 30 min at 50 °C in order to increase the yield of AgNPs. Finally, the GT AgNPs were separated by centrifugation (6000 rpm) and washed with 50% acetone and allowed to dry at room temperature.
Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of GT AgNPs with different sizes below 50 nm (ranging from 15 to 33 nm), which are predominantly dispersed in the form of aggregates. The nanoparticles were not in direct contact with each other within the formed aggregates, which can be explained by the stabilizing action of capping agents present in the extract. These phytochemicals are known to play an active role in reducing and stabilizing metal nanoparticles.34
