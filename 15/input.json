Synthesis of NPs. 
For ZnO NPs, zinc acetylacetonate was used as the precursor and
PEG 8000 in the triple role of capping agent, reducing agent, and
solvent. In detail, 0.28 g (1.06 mmol) of Zn(acac)2 and 1 g (0.125
mmol) of PEG 8000 were mixed and dissolved while the temperature
was set at 200 °C. In the case of CuO NPs, PEG was used solely for
coating the forming NPs, while hydrazine was also incorporated in the
procedure as a reducing agent. 0.103 g (2 mmol) of N2H4·H2O was
stirred drop by drop to a blue aqueous solution of 0.5 g (2 mmol) of
Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and then a solution of 16 g (2 mmol) of PEG 8000
was also added to the mixture. The stainless-steel autoclave was
cooled gradually to room temperature (RT). Centrifugation at 5000
rpm for 20 min was followed in order to discard the supernatant
liquids. The obtained precipitates were washed with ethanol at least
three times to remove the excess of agents and precursors.
For the bimetallic NPs, we used the microwave accelerated
reaction system, Model MARS 6-240/50-CEM, and we slightly
modified a former synthetic protocol.43 Specifically, Zn(NO3)2·4H2O
(2.0 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (2.0 mmol) were mixed and
dissolved in 40 mL of TrEG. The reaction was carried out at 265 °C
with a hold time of 30 min and a ramp time heating step (from 25 to
265 °C) set at 15 min.
Characterization of the NPs.
Based on the results
of our previous studies, we selected the solvothermal method
in autoclaves to prepare PEGylated CuO and ZnO NPs,
whereas in the case of nanobrass CuZn, microwave-assisted
polyol synthesis was used. The Xray patterns of the freshly prepared NPs are depicted in Figure
1a. The illustrated peaks confirm that ZnO NPs get crystallized
in the hexagonal structure (#89-0510) and CuO NPs in the
monoclinic system (#80-1916). In the case of CuZn NPs, it is
very crucial to find the proportion of the two metals. The peaks
at around 55 and 65° presented in the XRD spectrum (Figure
1a, black color) verify the formation of the α-brass facecentered cubic phase (#65-6567).
TEM images (Figure 1b) illustrate uniformly shaped NPs
with an almost spherical shape derived from all the syntheses.
Concerning their size, CuO NPs appeared to be smaller with a
mean size of approximately 15 nm, while ZnO NPs were the
biggest, with a mean diameter of around 35 nm. CuZn NPs,
with a mean size of 21 nm, were aligned in a rope made from
the polyol used or its derivate formed in the autoclave system
upon oxidation and/or fragmentation of TrEG.49
