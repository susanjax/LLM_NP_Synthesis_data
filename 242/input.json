Preparation of flower sample
To eliminate dust particles, the flower material was cleaned with deionized water and air-dried to remove moisture content. The flower sample was then weighed and homogenized before being transferred to a 250 mL screw cap container containing 100 mL distilled water. The container was placed in a magnetic stirrer for 10–15 min to ensure adequate mixing, after which the aqueous extract was filtered and kept at 4 °C in an airtight container.

2.3. Synthesis of AuNPs
For the synthesis of AuNPs, 10 mL of aqueous extract was mixed with 90 mL of 1 mM AuCl3 solution and the color shift was noticed. The AuNPs solution was then spun at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C to purify it. The resulting pellet was then dried and stored at room temperature for future use after being suspended in deionized water.

Morphological characterization of JIF-AuNPs
As shown in
Fig. 5
A, spherical-shaped nanoparticles with a size of 28 to 43 nm were obtained and an average size of the particles was discovered to be 37.7 nm using TEM analysis. (
Fig. 5
H). The elemental composition was studied by EDX analysis. The absorption of metallic gold nanocrystallites was characterized by strong EDX signals at 1.8, 2.1, and 2.5 keV. The polycrystalline nature of the JIF-AuNPs was depicted by the SAED pattern of the corresponding area observed under TEM. The well-resolved diffraction rings of polycrystalline gold may be seen in the diffraction pattern. A series of significant planes with hkl values (111, 200, 220, and 311) of JIF-AuNPs were represented by strong and moderate-intensity rings (
Fig. 5
I). The average size of the JIF-AuNPs was calculated as 38.8 nm, with a PDI of 1.52 (
Fig. 6
A) by dynamic light scattering analysis, and the zeta potential was discovered to be −0.3 mV (
Fig. 6
B). XRD analysis showed four strong diffraction peaks at 37.9°, 44.1°, 64.5°, and 77.5° which were correlated to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) planes respectively, and they were associated with the face-centered cubic structure of gold (ICDD No. 4-0783) (
Fig. 7
). The average size of the JIF-AuNPs was computed using the Scherrer formula and found to be 6.9 nm.
