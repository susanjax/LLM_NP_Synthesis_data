Preparation of Bixa orellana seed extract
25 g of seed was weighted carefully and transferred it in a beaker of 1000 mL containing 250 mL of distilled water and 1 mL of 1 M Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution was added to it. The mixture was warmed at 70 °C with continuous stirring for 30 min on hot plate magnetic stirrer. The 1st extract was collected by filtering with clean muslin cloth. Again 250 mL of distilled water and 1 M NaOH solution was added to that beaker containing seed residue and stirred for 2 h at 70 °C. The 2nd extract was collected by filtering with another muslin cloth and both of the filtrates were mixed together. Finally, the filtrate was filtered again through Whatmann filter paper (
Fig. S1
) and stored at 4 °C prior synthesis of nanoparticles.

Green synthesis of silver nanoparticle
1 mM silver nitrate solution was used as the source of silver. Seed extract and silver nitrate solution were mixed together with ratio of 1:1. 5 mL of 1 M NaOH solution was added to the mixture to facilitates the reduction of silver ions by generating intermediates that are more easily reduced to zero valence silver (
Park et al., 2020
). The mixture was continuously stirred at 400–500 rpm on a magnetic stirrer. The flow of nitrogen gas was supplied during synthesis to make inert atmosphere to prevent the formation of silver oxide. The mixture turned into dark brown color within few minutes but the reaction was continued for 2 h to maximize the AgNPs synthesis. The bio synthesized AgNPs were kept at room temperature for 24 h. The prepared AgNPs were washed by using dialysis membrane technique (dialysis membrane 60, Himedia, India). The washed nanoparticles were stored in a cool, dry, dark place and later their characterization was performed.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis has confirmed the crystalline nature of the synthesized AgNPs and the powder XRD pattern is shown in
Fig. 6
. Bragg Reflection peaks as shown by silver nanoparticles were found at 38.1°, 44.2°, 64.6° and 77.5° that correspond to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) planes of face centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure of metallic silver, respectively (
Rabbi et al., 2020
,
Venkatadri et al., 2020
,
Jemal et al., 2017
). The reflection planes have a good match with the Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standard (JCPDS File No. 04–0783) corresponding to the reflections of crystal planes. Synthesized silver nanoparticles are composed of pure crystalline silver. The peak corresponding to (1 1 1) plane is more intense than the other planes, suggesting that the (1 1 1) plane is in the predominant orientation.
