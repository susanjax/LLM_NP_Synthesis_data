Preparation of Co3O4-NPs from Lawsonia inermis plant extract
A resultant mixture of 50 ml of an aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (0.1 M) and 50 ml of the Lawsonia inermis plant leaves and bark extract as fuel (
Scheme 1
), was heated at 70 °C for about two hours. During the heat, the brown colour was changed into a dark brown colour. To maintain the reaction mixture at pH 11 some amount of ammonia solution was also added. Due to this, the colour of the solution changes from brown to bluish-green. Continue the heating with stirring then the solution changes to a deep red brown colour which indicates the formation of the Cobalt (III) complex. Then cooled to room temperature, washed and centrifuged followed by washing several times with water and finally with methanol. The co-precipitation method was used in the whole process. Then collect, dry, and calcinate the precipitate at 600 °C for 4 h and the resultant dry powder is the Co3O4 NPs. At 600–700 °C the cobalt(III) complex changes to Co3O4 as shown in equation. The collected powder was finally sent for characterization studies.

Dynamic light scattering analysis
Dynamic Light Scattering analysis is helpful for the analysis of the particle size and Zeta potential analysis is useful for the surface charge determination. The Nanoparticle SZ-100 instrument was used for the determination of the particle size and surface charge of synthesized Co3O4 NPs. The particle distribution spectrum was plotted between the diameter (nm) on the X-axis and frequency (%/nm) on the Y-axis. The zeta potential spectrum was recorded between the zeta potential (mV) and intensity (a.u) on the X and Y-axes. The synthesized Co3O4 NPs exhibited 154.1 nm size with −87.7 mV zeta potential (
Table 1
). From zeta potential, the stability of nanoparticles will be analyzed which directly depends on the magnitude of the charge. So, the nanoparticle with more magnitude of either positive or negative charge exhibits excellent physical colloidal stability
[63]
. In the present case, the higher stability of Co3O4 NPs may be due to the more negative charge which results from the electrostatic repulsions (
Fig. 2
a and b).

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
The confirmation of the successful synthesis of Co3O4 NPs was done by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. The XRD patterns of synthesized Co3O4 NPs from Lawsonia inermis plant extracts were analyzed from
Fig. 4
. These synthesized CoO NPs showed the miller indices peaks at (1 1 1), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 2 2), (4 0 0), (4 2 2), (5 1 1), (4 4 0), (5 3 1), (6 2 0), and (5 3 3) disclosed the polycrystalline cubic structure of the Cobalt oxide nanoparticles. These peaks were in good agreement with the JCPDS Card No: 073-1701 and also with the previous reports
[67]
. The shape of NPs investigated from FESEM images was found to agree with the XRD data.

Morphology studies of Co3O4 NPs
The structural morphology of the Co3O4 was characterized by a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).
Fig. 5
a and b shows the FESEM image of synthesized Co3O4 at different magnifications of 1 µm and 400 nm. These nanoparticles are uniform with little agglomeration and they are in a rough cubic and spherical shape (
Fig. 5
b). The average size of these nanoparticles is 98.05 nm. The Co3O4 NPs dimension from the FESEM image is almost near to the particle size spectra of DLS (
Fig. 2
a). The EDX graph (
Fig. 6
) and its analysis are used for the elemental composition of Co3O4 NPs. Strong signals for the Cobalt (Co) and Oxygen (O) atoms in the nanoparticles were observed and data revealed that the Co3O4 NPs have a Cobalt (Co) rich environment in the lattice. From the EDX investigation, the calculated weight percentage of the Cobalt is 72.68 % and the oxygen weight percentage is 27.32 %.
