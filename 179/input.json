Synthesis of Va-AgNPs

The green synthesis of Va-AgNPs was performed using leaf extracts of V. amygdalina and silver nitrate (AgNO3) metal salt precursors with the help of a magnetic stirrer equipped with a hot plate. The overall procedure of synthesis of Va-AgNPs is illustrated in 
Fig. 1
, in which phytochemical components are extracted from leaves and then used for the reduction purpose of AgNO3. The particle size distribution of Va-AgNPs was analyzed using Particle Size Analyzer (PSA) and a Zetasizer Nano instrument (Nano ZS) with model number ZEN 3600 (Malvern Instrument Ltd., Worcestershire, UK). As indicated in the supporting information, the size distribution is observed to be less than 100 nm.

Characterization 
The XRD pattern showed four intense peaks for 2θ values ranging from 27° to 80°. A comparison of the obtained XRD spectrum with the standard confirmed that the silver particles formed in the four intense peaks appeared at 38.109, 44.14°, 64.47°, and 77.37° for pH-5 and 38.0946°, 41.4385°, 64.494°, and 77.349° for pH-7. However, peaks at 27°, 32°, 46°, 54°, and 57° were observed for both of them, which shows the oxide form. This Va-AgNPs result was consistent with the green synthesis of AgNPs using G. ofcinalisw plant extract. The XRD peaks in degrees 2θ appear at 38.0946°, 41.4385°, 64.494°, and 77.349° this can be attributed to the planes (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) sets of lattice planes of crystal. The relation between the distances between two planes of AgNPs synthesized at pH-5 is 0.031 A° and for Ag synthesized at pH-7, it is 0.21 A°. The average crystal size of Ag for PH-5 was 7.04 nm and PH-7 was 4.26 nm.
