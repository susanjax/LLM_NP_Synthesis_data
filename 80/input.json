Preparation and characterization of colloidal AuNPs, PtNPs, and AuPtNPs
5 g of fresh leaves of P. australis plant was extracted with 100 mL of distilled water at 60 °C for 15 min. The obtained filtrates were stored at 4 °C until further use. To prepare AuPtNPs, 10 mL aqueous leaf extract was added to 100 mL of 1 mM aqueous mixture of HAuCl4 and K2PtCl4 in a flask and stirred at 85 °C for 1 h. The reaction was monitored at pre-determined time intervals using a double beam UV–visible spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 60) at 1 nm resolution. The obtained aliquots were centrifuged, and the resulting pellets were dried under vacuum. For control experiments, monometallic AuNPs and PtNPs were also prepared using their corresponding salts.

The UV-spectra in Fig. S1 showed the emergence of Au plasmon absorption at 553 nm (Fig. S1A) and the disappearance of the 322, 384, and 472 nm Pt (II) peaks (Fig. S1B), indicate the successful formation of AuNPs and PtNPs respectively [10,40]. The TEM micrograph clearly revealed that the AuPtNPs were mostly flower-like in shape with an average particle size of ~35.1 ± 2.71 nm (Fig. 3B) and poly-dispersity index (PDI) of 0.121 ± 0.11. This supports the broad peaks of the absorption spectra of AuPtNPs at 572 nm.
To understand the crystalline behavior of the AuPtNPs and its DOX conjugation, XRD was used to characterize the materials. As seen in Fig. 5A, AuPtNPs showed five major peaks at 38.1°, 44.1°, 64.7°, 77.8° and 81.8° corresponding to (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) planes. The broad peaks noticed indicated that Pt atoms are present within the Au matrix. This is consistent with the face-centered cubic (fcc) phase of AuPt alloyed nanoparticles as previously reported [26,42]. The intensity of the (111) plane was much higher than other planes, indicating that the AuPtNPs crystal growth preferred the (111) directions. An interplanar lattice spacing of about 0.235 nm was calculated for the AuPtNPs using Bragg's equation
