Synthesis of CuO nanoparticles
Copper (II) nitrate (Cu(NO3)2) of purity of 99.9%,
purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA),
was used for the preparation of CuO NPs. 30 ml of
0.1 M of Cu(NO3)2 was mixed with 20 ml of Mint
extract and stirred at 100 °C for 30 min. The Mint
extract showed a dark-blue colour whereas the copper nitrate was brown. Once the product had been
changed to dark green after filtering and washing
with DI, the solution was treated hydrothermally at
180 °C for two hours. Then, the solution was left to
dry naturally and get CuO NPs. Figure 1 shows the
gradual change of the mixture colour until getting
a black powder of CuO NPs. This change might be
attributed to the surface Plasmon resonance of metal
oxide [20,21].

Characterization of CuO nanoparticles.
Characterisation of the synthesised CuO NPs was
achieved using different tools. UV-Vis absorption
was obtained by UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV1800, Shimadzu, Japan). The surface morphology of
CuO NPs was characterised using SU8230 Hitachi
field-emission scanning electron microscope. Also,
with the help of Shimadzu-XRD 6000X diffractometer
of a Cu-Kα X-ray source (0.15406 nm), XRD for the
crystalline structure of the nanoparticles was
determined.
The θ/2θ XRD scan for the CuO NPs within a Bragg
angle range of 20° ‒ 80° is illustrated in Figure 2.
Different peaks are located at 37.03 °, 43.23 °, 63.46 °,
and 76.41° which correspond to (111), (200), (220) and
(222) reflection planes, respectively. These diffraction
planes indicate a polycrystalline cubic structure and are
fully matching with the standard powder diffraction
card (JCPDS, 05–661). The crystallite size of the strongest peak of the CuO NPs was calculated to be 23 nm
using the well-known Scherrer equation.
The surface morphology of the CuO NPs is shown in
Figure 3. The nanoparticles show irregular shapes with
a variation of size, and some nearly nanosheets shape,
which are different from spherical-shape nanoparticles
prepared using Tilia extract [22], and cubical-shape CuO
NPs synthesised using green Alga Botryococcus braunii [23].
