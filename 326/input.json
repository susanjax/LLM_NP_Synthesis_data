Preparation of ZnO NPs
The citrate containing Artocarpus gomezianus fruit source was collected from Mangalore, Karnataka. The collected fresh, healthy fruits were washed thoroughly using double distilled water and cut into small pieces. Then small pieces were dried at room temperature for 10 days under dust free conditions and subsequently grinded into a fine powder. 10 g of this fine powder were boiled in 100 mL doubled distilled water to prepare a 10% crude solution, then filtered and stored in refrigerator for further usage. In a typical synthesis, 5 mL of the 10% crude solution was added to 3 g of Zn(NO3)2.6H2O which is already dissolved in 10 mL of double distilled water. This reaction mixture was well mixed using a magnetic stirrer for about 5–10 min and then placed in a preheated muffle furnace maintained at about 400 ± 10 °C. The reaction mixture boils froths and thermally dehydrates to form foam. The whole process was completed in a few min. Similar procedure was repeated by taking 10 and 15 mL of the 10% crude sample.

Fig. 1 shows the PXRD patterns of spherical ZnO NPs prepared by different volume of citrate containing 10% Artocarpus gomezianus fruit extract (5–15 mL) as fuel via a green solution combustion method. The diffraction peaks are shown corresponding to the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO (JCPDS NO. 36-1451) and average crystallite size (d) was estimated using the Scherrer's equation [18].
Fig. 3 shows the TEM image of the ZnO NPs prepared using 5, 10 and 15 mL of citrate containing Artocarpus gomezianus fruit extract as a fuel. It clearly shows that the nanoparticles are of sizes in the range 10–30 nm and spherical in shape of rather uniform dimension.
