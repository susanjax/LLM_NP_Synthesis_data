Green synthesis of Silver nanoparticles
6% extract (10ml) was mixed with 1mM AgNO3 (90ml) in 200 ml flask and allowed the reaction at room temperature. This extract reduced the silvernitrate into silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) that was confirmed by visible color changes (yellow to dark brown) of the solution. Then 2 ml of this solution was taken and absorbance was recorded at 200-800nm using UVâ€“Visible spectrophotometer (Systronics, AU-2701). Then solution was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 15 minutes and pellets were collected. Further this pellet was washed three times using 5 ml deionized water and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm [28].
Characterization of Silver nanoparticles
The XRD result of silver nanoparticles was contains planes at 111, 200 and 220. These planes confirmed the formation of crystalline silver nanoparticles which was matched by standard silver planes (Fig. 2).
The TEM results confirmed that silver nanoparticles were spherical shape (Fig. 3A), the diffraction ring confirmed that silver nanoparticles was polycrystalline (Fig. 3B). The variable size of silver nanoparticles was formed that size ranged from 10-40 nm. But 20 nm size particles were maximum in number (Fig. 3C). The appearance of intense peaks at 3 KeV were proved that silver nanoparticles was elemental (Fig. 3D).
