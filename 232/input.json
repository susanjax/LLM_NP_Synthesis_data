Synthesis of Cu and Fe/Mn dual doped ZnO MNPs
The Zn0.98Cu0.02O (Z1), Zn0.96Cu0.02Mn0.02O (Z2) and Zn0.96Cu0.02Fe0.02O (Z3) MNPs were prepared by the sol-gel method. The desired quantities of Zinc acetate dihydrate ((CH3COO)2Zn.2H2O) and Cupric acetate monohydrate ((CH3COO)2Cu.H2O) were dissolved in N, N-Dimethyl formamide (C3H7NO) one by one and the molarity was fixed in accordance with the composition. The temperature of the solution was kept at 80 °C until a gel was formed. The gel was tried using a muffle furnace at 150 °C and the final product was grounded well to get a fine powder. The synthesized nanoparticles had been annealed at the temperature of 500 °C in the air for 2hrs to remove impurities and imperfections. The same procedure was repeated for all dopants. Because of the solubility limit, the concentration of dopants was fixed to 2%. Golic et al. experimentally proven the existence of Zinc hydroxide and acetic acid like intermediates during the ZnO formation by XRD and TGA studies [

]. Hence, the reaction involved in the formation of ZnCuO structures can be written as [

The X-ray diffraction patterns of the (Cu, Fe/Mn) dual doped ZnO MNPs are shown in
Fig. 1
. There is no deviation in the hexagonal wurtzite structure (space group P63mc, 186, JCPDS data card No. 36–1451) of pure ZnO by TM doping. Meanwhile, the TMs doping could be able to produce the modifications in the position of peak and peak intensity, due to distortions produced in the lattice. The Debye Scherrer's formula is used to determine the average crystallite size of the MNPs,
where λ is the wavelength of the X-ray (1.5406 Å), β is the angular peak width at half maximum in radian and θ is diffraction angle. When 2% of Fe ions are dual doped with ZnCuO, the average crystallite size is reduced from 23.1 nm to 19.2 nm and the crystallite size is reduced to 17.3 nm when Mn is doped with ZnCuO MNPs. The ion incompatibility between dopant ion and host Zn ion creates deformations and defects on the surface of MNPs which can cause successive growth of the MNPs [

]. Therefore, the average crystallite size of the MNPs gets shrinkage, when TMs doped with ZnCuO.
