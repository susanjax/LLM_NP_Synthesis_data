Preparation of ZnO-CMC dispersion
ZnO-CMC NPs were prepared based on our previous study (Qu et al., 2022). The 0.15 g CMC was added in 50 mL water at 90 °C and stirred continuously for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature, 0.5 g zinc nitrate hexahydrate was added followed by addition of 25 mL 0.2 M sodium hydroxide solution to induce formation and conversion of zinc hydroxide to ZnO in alkaline medium. To obtain the NPs, precipitates were collected after centrifugation (8000 rpm for 20 min), triple washed and mild heated (80 °C for 1 h). As to the preparation of ZnO and ZnO-CMC dispersion, 6 mg dried commercial ZnO or ZnO-CMC NPs powders were added to 2.5 mL double distilled water. ChAc/ZnO-CMC dispersion was prepared via addition of 6 mg ZnO-CMC NPs powders in 2.5 mL 55 mM ChAc solution. All three mixtures were sonicated using probe sonicator (Misonix Sonicator® 3000, USA) in 50:10 pulse on/off cycle with 30% power for 10 min.

Aggregation propensity of commercial ZnO, ZnO-CMC and ChAc/ZnO-CMC NPs was evaluated using AFM and TEM. Apparently, a high aggregation pattern could be observed in ZnO (
Fig. 1a
 and b) and ZnO-CMC dispersions (
Fig. 1c
 and d). As illustrated in TEM images, commercial ZnO (
Fig. 1b
) are semi-spherical in shape while the as-prepared ZnO-CMC (
Fig. 1d
 and f) giving an irregular shape but relatively homogeneous dimensions, which confirmed with the SEM observation in our previous study (
Qu & Luo, 2022
). AFM (
Fig. 1e
) revealed a smaller and uniform size distribution for ChAc/ZnO-CMC dispersion. Thereby, ChAc was believed to be responsible for the better dispersibility and decreased agglomeration of ZnO-CMC NPs. This phenomenon could be explained on the basis that the electrical double layer, created by positively and negatively charged clusters of ChAc, was formed on the surface of ZnO-CMC NPs. Aggregation tendency of individual ZnO-CMC NPs was restrained as a result of enhanced repulsion among individual NPs (
Aditya et al., 2018
).
