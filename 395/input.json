This study aimed to fabricate and characterize Mesoporous calcium silicate nanoparticles (MCSNs) and silver-incorporated Mesoporous calcium silicate nanoparticles (Ag-MCSNs) as bioactive nanoparticles either for hybridization with contemporary endodontic materials to improve their bioactivity, and to achieve both low cytotoxicity and enhanced antibacterial activity or as new multifunctional materials.
Materials
Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were acquired from (Sigma Aldrich Co. USA). Ammonium hydroxide, calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Ca(No3)2.4H2O), silver nitrate (AgNO3), and Tris-HCL (1 M, pH7.4), originating from (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. China).
2.2. Synthesis of MCSN and nanosilver-incorporated MCSN (Ag-MCSN)
According to Wu et al., 2012, MCSNs were synthesized utilizing a template technique [12]. Briefly, 600 mL of deionized or double-distilled water (ddH2O) was used for dissolving CTAB (6.6 g), and then ammonium hydroxide was added dropwise (12 mL). After 30 min of stirring, calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (31.2 g) and TEOS (30 mL) were added. The mixture was well mixed for 3 h before being rinsed 3 times with double-distilled water (ddH2O) and 100% ethanol, respectively. The powders were gathered, then dried in the oven at 60 °C for a whole night and then calcination was done at 550 °C on the stove for 2 h to remove any last remnants of CTAB. The same procedures were used to create nanosilver MCSNs (Ag-MCSNs) using the templated method, but 4,911 g of silver nitrate (AgNO3) was added along with (31.2 g) of calcium nitrate tetrahydrate and 30 mL of TEOS. The powders that were obtained were given the name Ag-MCSNs. (Fig. 1).
The effective diameter of MCSNs (152.3 nm) and Ag-MCSNs (177.9 nm) after being polydispersed in water with a polydispersity of (0.005) at 25 °C temperature was revealed by DLS analysis using particle size analyzer.
The FE-SEM at various magnifications showed that MCSNs and Ag-MCSNs had spherical shapes, with nanoparticle diameters ranging from 100 to 350 nm. (Fig. 5a and b).
