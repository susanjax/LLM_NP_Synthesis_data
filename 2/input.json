Synthesis of RhNPs
RhNPs were synthesized according to the experimental procedure described in a previous work [25] by reducing
0.25 mM of RhCl3·3H2O with 2.5 mM borohydride in the
presence of 0.25 mM citrate ions as stabilizers and mixing
for 10 min under stirring.
Characterization of RhNPs
The AFM images show relatively uniform RhNPs without
aggregates. Based on the topographical height profile (section
analysis) the size of the particles lied between 4.0 and 8.0 nm
with an average size of 6.5 nm (depth profile analysis) while
the average hydrodynamic diameter of the particles, calculated by DLS, was equal to 9.2 nm (Fig. S1). Similar results were
also obtained in a previous work [25] indicating the good
reproducibility of the synthetic procedure.
The concentration of RhNPs was calculated according to
the method described previously [28] assuming the complete
reduction of RhCl3 and that each nanoparticle has a spherical
shape with a uniform face centered cubic (fcc) structure. The
molar concentration of RhNPs of 7 nm size was calculated to
be 1.4 nmol L−1 which corresponds to 8.4 × 1011 nanoparticles
per mL (nps mL−1
) of solution.
