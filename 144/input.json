Green synthesis of hematite nanoparticles
Freshly prepared piper betel leaf extract was added to 50 mL 0.1 M aqueous solution of Ferric Chloride with stirring using a magnetic stirrer for 1 h. The orange coloured solution of ferric chloride changed to brownish black on the addition of leaf extract, with the formation of a black coloured precipitate. The mixture was then sonicated for 30 min, filtered, washed with distilled water and dried. The dried precipitate was heated in a muffle furnace at 600 °C for 3 h to obtain iron oxide nanoparticles.

Characterization
The XRD pattern of α-Fe2O3 (hematite) nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 1. The XRD peaks at 24.2°, 33.18°, 35.67°, 40.81°,49.47°, 54.1°, 57.60°, 62.46°, and 64.13° 2θ are assigned to the (0 1 2), (1 0 4), (1 1 0), (1 1 3), (0 2 4), (1 1 6), (0 1 8), (2 1 4) and (3 0 0) planes, respectively (Fig. 1). These results indicate a rhombohedral α-Fe2O3 phase and match with JCPDS card no. 33-0664. The mean size of hematite nanoparticles estimated using Debye-Sherrer formula was found to be 25.17 nm. Similar XRD results have also been reported earlier[20].
The TEM image indicates that the prepared nanoparticles are cubic in shape as shown in Fig. 3 with a particle size of 22 to 35 nm. This result is in good agreement with the particle size calculated using Debye-Scherrer’s equation. Most of the α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were found to be cubical with smooth edges. The SAED pattern in Fig. 4 confirms the nanocrystalline nature of the synthesized material.
