Preparation of CuNPs using MOS aqueous extract
Copper sulfate (350 mM) solution was prepared in distilled water. To this solution, a mixture of MOS aqueous extract was added drop-wise and stirred in a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm at 80 °C for 2 h and further for 12 h at room temperature. Formation of yellow particles confirmed the CuNPs synthesis. Centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min yielded the MOS-CuNPs. The MOS-CuNPs were washed three times with distilled water and dried at 50  °C to form a powder and stored at 4  °C for further use.

The UV–visible spectrum of MOS-CuNPs is shown in
Fig. 1
A. MOS-CuNPs showed λmax at 662 nm. SEM image revealed the amorphous nature of the MOS-CuNPs (

B). Cu in MOS-CuNPs was detected using EDX (
Fig. 1
C). Other than Cu, the distribution of O and Cl was also observed. XRD spectra of MOS-CuNPs showed diffraction peaks for CuO (monoclinic) at 32.18 (1 1 0), 36.19 (1 1 1), 39.63(2 0 2), 49.87(0 2 0), 53.41(1 1 3), 61.28 (3 1 1) and 73.5° (0 0 4) (

D). Uniform-sized MOS-CuNPs were formed with an average dimension of 7.38 nm as calculated by Debye-Scherrer formula. The FT-IR spectra of MOS-CuNPs showed peaks at 3442.35, 3337.79, 1653.12, 1540.16, 1447.64, 1096.42 and 845.84, which corresponds to OH of alcohol/phenol, NH of primary and secondary amine, Cdouble bondC of imines, Ndouble bondO of nitro, CH of alkane, Csingle bondO stretch and Csingle bondCl bond, respectively. Further peaks at 620.21 and 503.41 correspond to the CuO bond (
