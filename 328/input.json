Aspergillus niger mediated zinc oxide nanoparticle synthesis (ZnO NPs)
To prepare a biomass for the biosynthesis of ZnO NPs, the culture medium of fungus should be comprised of the liquid(g/l) K2HPO4, 2.0; (NH4)2SO4, 1.0; Yeast extract, 0.6;MgSO4•7H2O, 0.1; KH2PO4, 7.0; and glucose, 10.0. The pH level was fixed as 6.2 ± 0.2. The fungus was placed inside the flask and orbital shaker is used to incubate the fungus at 200 rpm and at the temperature of 37 °C. The culture of the fungi was then filtered through Whatman no.1 filter paper. 5 mM Zinc nitrate was added and kept in an shaking incubator at 200 rpm at 32 °C for 2 days. The White precipitate is produced at the bottom of the flask that indicates the reduction process. The white precipitate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Simultaneously, a positive control and negative control were maintained by incubating the fungus mycelium with de-ionized water and Zinc nitrate solution [25].
XRD analysis of ZnO NPs synthesized by A. niger
X-ray diffraction is performed with the intention of substantiate various phases of ZnO nanoparticles. In the Fig. 4, the standard wurtzite and XRD patterns of ZnO NPs are depicted. The phase identification of ZnO NPs is done using the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) with 2θ ranges from 20° to 80°, 0.02° s−1 of scanning rate and Cu Kα radiation of 0.1540 nm. The XRD peaks at 30.1°, 33.91°, 36.60°, 44.10°, 56.56°, 60.0°, 65.1°, 69.1° and 70.48° were identified as (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (2 0 0), (1 1 2), and (2 0 1) reflections, respectively. The product is found to have a fine crystalline structure as demonstrated by the sharper and stronger diffraction peaks. The average crystallite size (d) of ZnO NPs was estimated by Scherrer's formula was found to be 41 nm. Kohler et al., 1975 also stated the similar diffraction peaks at 1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0) [39], [40]
Morphology and the size of the ZnO NPs were detected using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). It is concluded from Fig. 5 that the particles in the samples were compactly arranged and were almost spherical in shape. Study like Emad et al., 2017 also examined the practices and morphology of ZnO NPs and found that the size is spherical in shape [41]. However, the study shows the size range is 41–75 nm but our study findings examined the ZnO NPs diameter was found to be 53–69 nm with an average size of 61 ± 0.65 nm. According to Raut et al., 2015 found the nanoparticle size is 11–25 nm and shows hexagonal in shape [42].
