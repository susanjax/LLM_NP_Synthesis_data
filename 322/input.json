 Chemical synthesis of ZnO NPs
ZnO NPs were synthesized by direct precipitation method using zinc nitrate and KOH as precursors. In this work, the aqueous solution (0.2 M) of zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2•6H2O) and the solution (0.4 M) of KOH were prepared with deionized water, respectively. The KOH solution was slowly added into zinc nitrate solution at room temperature under vigorous stirring, which resulted in the formation of a white suspension. The white product was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min and washed three times with distilled water, and washed with absolute alcohol at last. The obtained product was calcined at 500 °C in air atmosphere for 3 h.
2.4. Biosynthesized ZnO NPS using C. halicacabum leaf extract
The synthesis of ZnO NPs involved the mixing of aliquot amounts of Zinc Nitrate and C. halicacabum leaf extract in water. The C. halicacabum leaf extract (0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mL) was added to 10 mL of 1 mM (Zn(NO3)2•6H2O) aqueous boiled solution and kept at boiling condition for 20 min to get the colloids. The (Zn (NO3)2.6H2O) and aqueous leaf extract C. halicacabum show any color change primarily confirmed the production of ZnO NPs by a visual color change from turned light green in color.The reduction rate is found to increase with an increase in the quantity of the C. halicacabum leaf extract and the reaction rate was completed after 24 h.The material was powered using a mortar and pestle so, that got a fine powder, which is easy for further characterizations.
 The power X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of Chem.-ZnO NPs, and Biosynthesized using C. halicacabum leaf extract (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mL) for various concentrations. The diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern consist of the diffraction peaks of Chem.-ZnO NPs and Bio- ZnO NPs in the prepared product, several diffraction peaks appeared and all of them could be clearly attributed to the characteristic peaks of Chem.-ZnO NPs and it can be well indexed to hexagonal wurtzite structure by comparison with the data from (JCPDSICDD card: 75–0592) in Fig. 7 (a–d) The diffraction peaks with 2θ = 31.08°, 34.25°, 36.26°, 47.66°, 56.06°, 62.23°, 67.07°, and 76.70° correspond to the crystal plans of (100), (002), (101), (102), (103), (112) and (202) of Biosynthesized using C. halicacabum leaf extract (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mL) were confirmed the hexagonal quartzite structure respectively [19]. Here, no other impurity peaks are detected in the XRD patterns indicating that all products are rather purity of the nanoparticles formation. The high intensity peaks (100) and (101) have been used to estimate the average crystalline sizes of Chem.-ZnO NPs, and Biosynthesized using C. halicacabum leaf extract (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mL) for various concentrations of sample with the help of Scherer equation [20]
 The mean crystallite size of Chem.-ZnO NPs, is 65 nm as shown in Table 1a, whereas on different concentrations (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mL) of Biosynthesized using C. halicacabum leaf extract the estimated sizes are 62, 55 and 48 nm, respectively as shown in Tables 1b–d. The reduction of particle size from 65 to 48 nm on 0.6 mL of C. halicacabum leaf extract uing Bio- ZnO NPs this reveals its optimum level, a facile biosynthesis method to synthesize the ZnO NPs and effect of calcinations in this result agrees literature. No apparent diffraction peaks of any other minerals can be detected in the XRD patterns. There are no apparent characteristic peaks of C. halicacabum leaf extract uing Bio- ZnO NPs can be observed, indicating that the C. halicacabum has immersed into the ZnO NPs nanoparticles matrixes. In order to get nanocrystallite sizes increases, these final results confirmed the C. halicacabum has been leaf extract effectively in ZnO NPs matrixes and possibly enhanced the crystallinity, and crystallinity is extremely relevant to the full width at half maxima (FWHM) value further, the XRD profile shows that ZnO NPs are strongly crystallized with a preferred (111) orientation, which has been observed by other authors [21].
The morphology and microstructure of Chem.-ZnO NPs, and Biosynthesized ZnO NPs using C. halicacabum leaf extract (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mL) for various concentrations products were examined by SEM. The study of SEM gave a clear indication and dispersion of Chem.-ZnO NPs and Bio- ZnO NPs as shown in Figure (a–d), respectively. The distinctive images demonstrated that the particles were hexagonal quartzite structure with some surface agglomeration. This result indicates that the variation Chem.-ZnO NPs and Bio- ZnO NPs. The SEM analysis confirms the XRD analysis. Also, the substrate surface is well covered with grains that are almost uniformly distributed over the surface. The C. halicacabum leaf extract compositions as shows the smooth surface morphology and grain size of the particles controlled by C. halicacabum leaf extract using Bio- ZnO NPs. Increasing order of C. halicacabum leaf extract concentrations contributes to more regular structure and hexagonal and clear formation of Bio- ZnO NPs. Further, this good agreement between FT-IR and XRD studies [24].
