Synthesis of SiO2
Synthesis of SiO2 – general procedure 1. The Stöber method with modifications was used to synthesise the non-porous silica nanoparticles. [

] First a solution containing EtOH (25 mL), NH4OH (1.9 mL, 0.93 M), H2O (1.6 mL, 2.9 M) and TEOS (2.4 mL, 12.4 mmol, 1 equiv, 0.41 M) were added together. The reaction was left to stir (750 rpm) for 3 h at rt. After 3 h, a solution of antimicrobials was added and stirred at RT for 6 h. The silica nanoparticles were isolated by centrifugation (15 min, 7830 rpm) and washed with H2O (3 x 20 mL). After three cycles of the centrifugation-washing procedures, the silica nanoparticles were dried in-vacuo to yield a powder.
Taking advantage of the CPC-antibiotic interactions, we used the micelle incorporation to form SiO2 nanoparticles for delivery of dual antimicrobials. Briefly, a silica core is firstly formed for 3 h, then a solution containing CPC micelles with or without antibiotic of choice is added and silica growth continued for 6 h (
Fig. S9
). The size of micelles in the synthesis was studied by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) (
Fig. 7
). TEM of CPC-CPX micelles reveals two populations with average sizes of 3 ± 2 nm (n = 50) and 7 ± 2 nm (n = 50), while CPC-RIF micelles show a single population of 5 ± 1 nm (n = 50) (
Fig. S15
). The two populations of CPC-CPX micelles in TEM can be attributed to the drying process before imaging. Subsequently, the sizes of synthesised silica nanoparticles were explored by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The average nanoparticle sizes are 230 ± 25 nm for SiO2
 CPC-CPX and 300 ± 20 nm for SiO2
 CPC-RIF (n = 50). Confirmation of the presence of antibiotics was obtained by solid-state absorption spectroscopy (
Fig. 7
) of powders of the silica particles, SiO2
 CPC-CPX and SiO2
 CPC-RIF which show absorption bands at 340 nm and 330 nm and 480 nm, respectively, characteristic of the presence of CPX and RIF antibiotics.
