Collection and preparation of plant material
Fresh leaves of A. indica were collected around the JNIAS campus, Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The leaves were washed twice with tap water and thrice with distilled water. The leaves were then air dried in the incubator at 37 °C for three days and ground into powder using an electric blender. The leaves extract was prepared by mixing 20 gm of leaf powder with 300 mL of Milli-Q water (i.e. 66.66 mg/mL) in a 500 mL conical flask. The mixture was stirred and heated between 90 °C and 100 °C for 30 min using a hot plate with magnetic stirrer. After cooling the solution was subjected to centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was filtered with WhatmanNo.1 filter paper. The pH of the extract was 7.3 to 7.4. The extract was stored at 4 °C for further use. Here onwards A. indica leaf extract will be referred to as leaves extract.
2.3. Synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
For reduction of silver ions, required amount of leaves extract was added to 90 mL of 1 mM silver nitrate (AgNO3). The mixture was heated for at 100 °C for desired time with continuous stirring till the color of the solution changed from light green to yellow (Parashar et al., 2009).
