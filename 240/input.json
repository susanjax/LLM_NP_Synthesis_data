AgNPs embedded electrospun EHEC/PVA nanofiber
The antimicrobial EHEC/PVA nanofibrous mats were prepared by adding silver nitrate (AgNO3) to an aqueous solution. The AgNO3 salt was mixed with the polymer solution and subjected to UV radiation lamp at 25 W/m2 for a period of 10 min (
Nadtoka et al., 2019
). The milky white colour of the polymer solution turns light yellow to blackish brown in colour with increase in silver salt concentration from 0.5 to 2 % and the size of nanoparticles (
Pal et al., 2007
).The colour change of the polymer solution from white to blackish indicates the reduction of the AgNO3 salt from Ag+ ions to elemental silver Ag0, which gives the primary confirmation for the formation of silver nanoparticles. The particles were uniformly dispersed on the fiber surface with the particle size ranging from 10 to 25 nm

The SEM micrographs of electrospun nanofibers are shown in
Fig. 1
. The morphology reveals homogenous and uniform formation of nanofibers without any bead formation in all the cases. The fiber diameter is affected by the viscosity and conductivity of the polymeric solution. The polymer solutions having high viscosity could prevent the fracturing of the ejected solution during the spinning process.

The presence of longer stress relaxation time increases the diameter of the nanofibers to a certain extent (
Li et al., 2006
). Here, due to high charge density, the high elongation forces are imposed on the fiber diameter which results in the decrease of the fiber diameter with increase in the concentration of AgNPs from 0 % to 1 %. The synergic effect of viscosity and conductivity were responsible for decrease in the fiber diameters from 347 nm (0 %AgNPs) to 312 nm for 0.5 % AgNPs and 295 nm for 1 % AgNPs respectively. However the diameter of the fibers increased to 366 nm for 2 % AgNPs and this could be because of the formation of aggregates due to excess amount of AgNPs added in to the fiber matrix. The thickness of the nanofiber mat was measured using a screw gauge and reported as 11±1 μm. The magnification of the images was 15 K X
