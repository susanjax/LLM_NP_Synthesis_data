Preparation of ECO-loaded and ECO/Zn2+-loaded NPT
The ECO/zein nanoparticles (ECO-loaded NPT) were firstly prepared by the nano-precipitation method with slight modifications (Gonçalves et al., 2020). Briefly, zein (20 mg/mL) was added into ethanol solution (85 %, v/v) and stirred magnetically for 12 h. After the solution completely dissolved, ECO (0, 2, 4, 8 mg/mL) was added into the zein solution, respectively, and mixed with aqueous pluronic® F68 solution (1.5 %, m/v) at a volume ratio of 1:3. Then the mixtures were homogenized with Ultra Turrax (2800g, 5 min) and evaporated for 12 h to remove ethanol. The ECO/Zn2+ nanoparticles (ECO/Zn2+-loaded NPT) were prepared by adjusting the pH of ECO-loaded NPT to 12 to make the solution negatively charged. Then ZnSO4 was added, followed by shaking at 25 °C for 1 h, and dialyzing (500 Da) for 48 h to remove the sulfate ion.
The results of the characteristics of nanoparticles with various concentrations of ECO were showed in Table 3. Generally, nanoparticles with a diameter of 50–300 nm are suitable carriers for encapsulating EOs, and PDI between 0 and 0.3 indicates that the particles are evenly dispersed (Lin et al., 2019). The results in our present study indicated that the nanoparticles encapsulated both 2 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL ECO were in a suitable particle size and well dispersed. According to Liu et al., (2015), the increase of zeta potential (absolute value) can enhance the electrostatic repulsion between particles, the particles thus become more stable. Here, it was observed that nanoparticles encapsulated 4 mg/mL ECO exhibited the highest zeta potential (34.09 ± 0.8), indicating that the 4 mg/mL ECO-loaded NPT was more stable. In addition, the EE, which directly affected the antibacterial activity, reached to 40.66 % when the nanoparticles encapsulated 4 mg/mL ECO. Combined with the above analysis, nanoparticles encapsulated 4 mg/mL ECO had appropriate particle size, PDI, zeta potential, and EE. Thus, nanoparticles encapsulated 4 mg/mL ECO were selected for the subsequent experiments and zinc ion chelation. The ECO/Zn2+-loaded NPT possessed suitable particle size (275.43 nm), PDI (0.254), zeta potential (-31.12 mV), EE (23.47 %) and chelation rate (42.3 %). In general, ECO/Zn2+-loaded NPT had good stability.

The morphological changes of blank-NPT, ECO-loaded NPT, and ECO/Zn2+-loaded NPT obtained by TEM were showed in Fig. 3A, B, and C, respectively. Micrographs demonstrated that the nanoparticles synthesized by the nanoprecipitation method had uniform particle size and spherical shape, and the addition of ECO and Zn2+ did not change the shape of the nanoparticles. However, ECO-loaded NPT and ECO/Zn2+-loaded NPT possessed a larger diameter than the blank-NPT, which corresponded to the results of particle size measured above.
