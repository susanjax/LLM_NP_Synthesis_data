AuNPs biosynthesis
The biosynthesis of AuNPs was prepared as described from the previous method [45]. The triplicate of the filtered polychaetes crude extracts solution (5 ml) were mixed with 20 ml of gold (III) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4.3H2O) (1 mM) solution. The reaction solutions were incubated at room temperature with 150 rpm agitation in the dark for 24 h. The observation of the colour changes to red-ruby colour of the triplicate samples were periodically checked by naked eyes. In order to prevent particle aggregation and obtain a stable solution of AuNPs, the AuNPs solution was ultrasonicated for 60 s after 24 h of incubation, utilizing Powersonic 405 ultrasonicator at frequency of 40 kHz and power of 350 W.
Characterization of biosynthesized AuNPs
The particle size, morphology, and shape of biosynthesized AuNPs were investigated by using DLS, SEM and TEM. DLS was used to predict the particles size and particle size distribution of molecules in solution which exploits the Brownian motion phenomenon. The particle size is measured based on their hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) while polydispersity index (PDI) acts as an indication of the particles size distribution [71].The DLS results showed an average particle size of biosynthesized AuNPs was 24.36 nm with the PDI value of 0.2 (Fig. 4a), indicating a polydisperse distribution of the particles.
The biosynthesized AuNPs were observed to be nearly spherical in shape, as shown in the SEM image (Fig. 4b, indicated by red circle), which in consonance to the biological-mediated synthesis approach reported in both plant and animal species [19,45,[72], [73], [74]]. However, attributable to the poorly dispersed biosynthesized AuNPs, the agglomeration of particles was observed. Moreover, the limited resolution of SEM prevented viewing of the smaller size of biosynthesized AuNPs. Therefore, to confirm the morphology and structure of the biosynthesized AuNPs, further examination was performed utilizing TEM. The TEM image revealed the spherical shape of biosynthesized AuNPs (Fig. 4c), with particle sizes ranging from 10 nm to 60 nm. The average particle size distribution of biosynthesized AuNPs was also tabulated, with a preference for smaller particle size (∼20 nm) (Fig. 4d).
X-Ray diffraction analysis was performed on the crude extract of M. moribidii (polychaetes) to confirm that the synthesized AuNPs were not originally presented in the polychaete's body. Instead, they were successfully produced through the reduction of Au precursors by using the polychaete extract (Fig. 6a). M. moribidii crude extract did not exhibit any possible diffraction peaks of AuNPs confirming the presence of a broad peak with low intensity that belongs to the organic compounds in the polychaetes sample [45]. On the contrary, the XRD spectrum (Fig. 6b) of the biosynthesized AuNPs exhibited distinct primary diffraction peaks at 2θ values of approximately 38°,44°,64° and 77°. These peaks were indexed as the (111), (200), (220), and (311) Bragg's reflections, respectively, corresponding to the cubic structure of metallic gold [78].
