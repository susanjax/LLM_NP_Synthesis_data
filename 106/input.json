Chemical precipitation methods (CS-ZnO NPs)
About 0.3 M solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate was mixed with an equal volume of 0.2 M solution of sodium hydroxide. The mixture was kept under constant stirring for 2 hrs until a homogeneous solution was formed. The resulting precipitation has been filtered and deionized water rinsed. The sample was then dried overnight at 100°C and calcined for 2 hrs at 550°C to obtain ZnO NPs. The following process illustrate in Fig. 1. The main mechanism of chemical synthesis is illustrated in Eq. (1) and (2).
Green synthesis of ZnO NPs (GS-ZnO NPs)
About 100 ml of freshly prepared 0.3 M zinc nitrate hexahydrate solution was mixed with 100 ml of Vinca rosea leaf extract and warm for two hours at 60°C with constant stirring, and the solution changed color from green to brown, indicating the formation of the GS-ZnO NPs. The nanoparticles were separated by filtration using Whatman No: 1 and dried at 100°C for 2 hrs. The ZnO nanoparticles are calcined at 550°C for 2 hrs to remove impurities (Fig. 2(b)). CS-ZnO and GS-ZnO were powdered in a ceramic mortar for further analysis, using UV, FTIR to find out the purity, XRD, SEM, and TEM was used to find out particle size and the crystalline structure. In vitro method was used to find out the anticancer and antidiabetic activities. The main mechanism of green synthesis through Vinca rosea plants leaves is illustrated in Fig. 2(a)
Characterization of ZnO nanoparticles
Fig. 3 shows the XRD pattern of ZnO NPs generated by chemical precipitation and the green synthesis method. All of the diffraction peaks agree well with the hexagonal phase, which has lattice parameters of a = b ≠ c respectively 3.249 Å and 5.206 Å and also the nine characteristic peaks and crystal planes were matched those on JCPDS card no: 36–1451(Fig. 3). The strongest peak was the diffraction peak (101), suggesting the favoured growth plane. Under the same conditions, the diffraction peak strength increased noticeably with the method of green synthesising NPs. As a result, the green synthesising NPs increased crystallinity while lowering crystal size and diffraction intensity. Furthermore, because of the alkaloids that stabilised the GS-ZnO NPs, Bragg sharp peaks are seen. The capping agent's independent crystallization was ruled out by a calcination process followed by a purification process at 550 °C. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of both GS-ZnO NPs and CS-ZnO NPs as the varied particle sizes 16–41 nm, on the other hand, The results also showed an increase in the crystal size of ZnO NPs when the green synthesising NPs increased, which was similar to earlier findings [31]. As indicated in Table 1, the average crystal size of ZnO NPs was determined using the Debye Scherrer formula and the Williamson Hall formula of the peaks. ZnO NPs generated utilizing green synthesis and chemical methods have an average crystal size of 16–41 nm.
Electron microscopy is a vital tool for the flawless analysis of the size, shape, composition and spatial arrangement of the ZnO NPs. SEM study was highly useful to check the morphology of the synthesized ZnO NPs by changing synthesis method and the corresponding results shown in Fig. 4. Calcination at 550 °C produced ZnO NPs in spherical nanoparticles [32]. The micron-size particles were clearly observed in the surface of the sample CS-ZnO NPs and GS-ZnO NPs displayed in Fig. (4(A), (B)). The very few individual particles were observed. The high agglomeration was explained not only due to Vinca rosea leaf extract but also agglomeration during the drying process. Some particles were hexagonal in shape, and most of the particles were spherical shape. Most of the particles were agglomerated, and few individual particles were also observed.
