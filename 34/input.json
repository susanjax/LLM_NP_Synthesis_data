Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles
For the biosynthesis of Au-NPs (Gold nanoparticles), two boiling test tubes were taken, one containing 10 ml of 1 mM Hydrogen tetra chloro aurate (Himedia, Mumbai) solution as control and
the second tube containing 9 ml of 1 mM Hydrogen tetra chloro
aurate solution and 1 ml supernatant of Bacillus subtilis as test solution were incubated on shaker at room temperature for 24 hours.
After 24 hours, the cell free supernatant of gold nanoparticle solution thus obtained was purified by repeated centrifugation at 15,000
rpm for 20 minutes. Supernatant was discarded and the pellet was
dissolved in deionized water.
Characterization
The gold nanoparticles were confirmed by color changes and
characterized by UV-visible spectrophotometer on a Perkin Elmer
(Lamda 25). The UV-visible
spectra showed a strong Plasmon resonance centered approximately
minimum at about 530 nm after 24 hours (Curve 1 of Fig. 2) and
maximum at about 540 nm after 120 hours (Curve 2 of Fig. 2). Observation of this strong broad plasmon peak has been well documented for various Me-NPs, with sizes ranging all the way from 2
to 100 nm [15].
