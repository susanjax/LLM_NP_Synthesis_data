Synthesis of CuO NPs.
CuO NPs were synthesized using the aqueous extract of Tamarindus indica L. (Indian tamarind) fruit. The T. indica fruit was obtained from a local market. The fruit pulp (without seeds) was soaked in water for 60 minutes at room temperature. The aqueous extract of the fruit was prepared by extracting 10 g of fruit pulp with 100 mL of Milli-Q water at room temperature. The extract was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was concentrated and used. The extract was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was concentrated and used. Under heating and constant stirring, 10 mL of extract was slowly added to 100 mL of 3 μΜ copper acetate solution. The red precipitate was separated by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The precipitate was dried and stored [70].

Characterization of CuO NPs.
The characteristics of CuO NPs are shown in Figure 2. The formation of CuO NPs (Figure 2a) was initiated by the change from the blue color of copper acetate to green, greenish-yellow, yellowish orange, and finally to the brick-red precipitation of CuO NPs. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of CuO NPs displayed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 490 nm, as shown in Figure 2b. Once the CuO NPs were formed, the size distribution of particles was analyzed in a particle size analyzer, and the result is shown in Figure 2c, showing the homogeneous distribution of particles between 40 nm and 50 nm. The shape of the CuO NPs was observed to be cubes, as shown in Figure 2d. The elemental composition confirms the presence of Cu, as shown in Figure 2d. The participation of various functional groups present in the T. indica fruit involved in the synthesis of CuO NPs was recorded by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and the results are shown in Figure 2e. In CuO NPs, the presence of CuO is indicated by the presence of strong stretching vibrations of CuO at 590 cm−1. This confirms the metal oxide bond and the monoclinic phase of CuO NPs.
