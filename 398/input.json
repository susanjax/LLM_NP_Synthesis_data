Synthesis of polydopamine (PDA)
Aqueous ammonia solution (2.0 mL, 28%) and Milli Q water (90 mL) were mixed with ethanol (40 mL). Dopamine hydrochloride (0.5 g) was dissolved in deionised water (10 mL) and injected into the mixture. The reaction was left to proceed for 12 hours with mild stirring. Large aggregates were removed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes. PDA-NPs were obtained by centrifugation at 18 rpm for 30 minutes and washed four times. Estimated yield of the PDA-NPs is 50 mg; exact concentration was determined by freeze drying using mannitol as a cryoprotectant. Dried PDA was then washed by centrifugation with water three times and resuspended in water for a final concentration of 1 mg mL−1.
Formation of hybrid polydopamine–silver nanoparticles (PDA–Ag)
PDA-NPs (1 mL, 1 mg mL−1) were mixed with AgNO3 (1 mL, 1 g mL−1) and deionised water (8 mL). The reaction was left to proceed for 1 h with mild stirring at room temperature. The resulting solution was washed three times by centrifugation with water. Concentration was determined by freeze-drying 15 mL of PDA–Ag.
The preparation of PDA–Ag was confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy (Fig. 1b), DLS (Fig. 1c), and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM, Fig. 1d and e). The Ag NPs were found to have a broad absorption peak around 440 nm and TEM analyses an average size of 20 ± 4 nm. The spherical PDA carriers were found to have a size of 121 ± 11 nm prior, and 132 ± 19 nm after the growth of Ag NP. A zeta-potential of −21.3 ± 0.9 mV was obtained, which was lower than that of the 20 nm citrate-capped Ag NPs used as control (−38 ± 0.3 mV).

Prior to the assessment of their antibacterial activity, the impact of microwave exposure to PDA–Ag NPs was explored to estimate the level of any structural damage. To this end, UV-Vis, DLS, zeta-potential and TEM characterisation were performed after exposure to 1.3 W, 2.45 GHz microwaves in time intervals of 0, 2, 5, 30 and 60 minutes under pulsed excitation. The results obtained indicate there are no significant changes in size and the surface charge (as indicated by no differences in zeta potential) of the NPs upon microwave exposure (ESI Fig S1†)
