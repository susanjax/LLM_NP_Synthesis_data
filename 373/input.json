Comparative study of eco-friendly synthesis of AgNPs
The green-synthesis of AgNPs was achieved under both sunlight and dark conditions using PAE and CAE as biotemplates separately. For this purpose, 5 mL of PAE and CAE were added to 95 mL of 1 mM AgNO3 in separate flasks. After examining the pH of the reaction solutions, one flask was kept under light, and another was kept in the dark, with observations recorded. Additionally, biosynthesis of AgNPs was performed using microwave heating with PAE and CAE separately. Two groups of reaction solutions were prepared, each consisting of 5 mL CAE and 95 mL of 1 mM AgNO3. In one group, the reaction was directly exposed to microwave heating at Power 100 for 2 minutes without changing the pH (6.6) of the reaction solution. In the other group, the same reaction was performed with a basic pH of approximately 8.9 by adding 0.1 N NaOH solution. The color changes in the reaction solutions over time were monitored in all cases. A schematic representation of the comparative synthesis of AgNPs using callus and natural biomass of F. schweinfurthii via sunlight and microwave catalysis is shown in the graphical abstract.
2.3.1. Optimization of microwave-assisted biosynthesis of AgNPs using CAE and PAE
The optimization of AgNPs biosynthesis in the presence of microwave radiation was conducted by changing several key parameters including pH, microwave exposure time, concentration of the reducing and capping agents, namely PAE and CAE which were derived from F. shweinfurthii, and the concentration of AgNO3. Primarily, the impact of varying pH levels (6.6, 7.6, 8.6, and 9.6) on a synthesis of AgNPs was investigated under microwave-assisted conditions using PAE and CAE at 1 mM AgNO3 concentration. The solutions were prepared by combining AgNO3 solution, 10% (v/v) PAE/CAE and the pH of the reaction solution was adjusted to four different pH levels: 6.6, 7.6, 8.6, and 9.6 with microwave heating at P100 for 1 minute. Afterwards, these reaction solutions were cooled at room temperature and the final volume was made to 50 mL with MQ water. The UV–visible spectrum of each reaction solution was recorded (240–700 nm) to monitor the formation of AgNPs. Further, the impact of increasing microwave exposure time (1, 2, 3, and 5 minutes) on the green synthesis of AgNPs was investigated at 1 mM AgNO3 concentration, 9.6 pH adjusted using 0.1 N NaOH, 10% of PAE and CAE individually. A similar procedure was followed and the progress of AgNPs synthesis was monitored using a UV–visible spectrophotometer. Likewise, the effects of varying concentrations of PAE/CAE (5, 10, and 20% v/v) on the synthesis of AgNPs was optimized at fixed 1 mM AgNO3 concentration, pH 9.6, and microwave heating at P100 for 3 mins. A similar procedure was performed altering the subsequent volume of MQ water to get the final volume of 50 mL reaction solution and spectra recorded using a UV–visible spectrophotometer. Afterward, the effects of different AgNO3 (1, 2, and 3 mM) concentrations on AgNPs synthesis were investigated at 20% v/v PAE, CAE, and microwave heating for 3 minutes at P100 separately analogous to Ashraf et al., (2020). A similar procedure was followed for each reaction solution monitored using a UV–visible spectrophotometer for AgNPs production.
2.3.2. Optimization of sunlight-assisted biosynthesis of AgNPs using PAE and CAE
This study aimed to optimize the biosynthesis of AgNPs using sunlight-assisted methods including two natural extracts PAE and CAE of FS. The effect of variable concentrations of PAE and CAE of FS, varying concentrations of AgNO3 and exposure time to bright sunlight on green synthesis of AgNPs were investigated referring to Yin et al., (2012). Firstly, the reactions were conducted with different concentrations of CAE and PAE (5, 10, 20, and 40% v/v), while maintaining a constant AgNO3 concentration (1 mM) and 10 min of time of exposure to bright sunlight separately. For this purpose, solutions were prepared by combining specific volumes of PAE, CAE, AgNO3, MQ water in separate containers, thoroughly mixed without foaming and exposed to bright sunlight until a red-brown color appeared. Its UV–visible spectrums were monitored to check the progress of the reaction in the range of 240–700 nm. Similarly, the effects of various AgNO3 concentrations (1, 2, 3, and 6 mM) on the AgNPs synthesis were studied by keeping constant concentrations of CAE and PAE (40%) and a 10-minute exposure to bright sunlight. A similar procedure was followed altering the volumes of AgNO3 solution and UV–visible Spectra were recorded to monitor the progress of AgNPs biosynthesis. Furthermore, the effect of increasing exposure time to bright sunlight (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min) was assessed at fixed AgNO3 concentration (1 mM) and 40% v/v of PAE and CAE. The progress of AgNPs production was monitored using a UV–visible spectrophotometer.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a valuable research tool used to confirm the synthesis of AgNPs using various chemical and biological methods, to determine the crystalline structure of the obtained AgNPs, and to assess their particle size. Fig. 4(b) shows the XRD spectral overlay patterns of four different AgNPs: PS-AgNPs and CS-AgNPs synthesized using an aqueous solution of 1 mM AgNO3, 20% PAE, and 40% CAE with sunlight exposure for 10 minutes, and PM-AgNPs and PS-AgNPs synthesized using plant and callus extracts of FS, respectively, with microwave heating. Its individual separate XRD spectrum is given in the supplementary file (Fig. S3). The XRD diffraction peaks for CM-AgNPs (2θ = 27.7º, 32.18 º, 46.22 º, 54.8º, 57.44º, 77.88º), CS-AgNPs (2θ = 27.76 º, 32.2 º, 46.18º, 54.82º, 57.52º, 76.88º), PM-AgNPs (2θ = 27.8º, 32.2º, 46.14º, 54.8º, 57.38º, 77.76º) and PS-AgNPs were as 27.84º, 32.24º, 46.24º, 54.8º, 57.5º and 76.82º. These peaks can be attributed to the (200), (200), (111), (101), (101), and (101) crystallographic planes, respectively, indicating a face-centered cubic crystal structure (fcc) characteristic of metallic silver. This finding aligns with similar results reported by Kumar and Yadav, (2009) and Jeeva et al., (2014), who observed crystalline peaks at 2θ values of 32.28°, 46.28°, 54.83°, 67.47°, and 76.69°, which are commonly found in XRD patterns. These distinctive peaks are a result of the presence of phytochemical compounds coating the silver nanoparticles, contributing to variations in the X-ray diffraction pattern. The stronger intensities of these planes further supported silver as the primary constituent for biosynthesis. Notably, despite differences in synthesis methods, the XRD patterns of all four types of nanoparticles (PS-AgNPs, CS-AgNPs, PM-AgNPs, and CM-AgNPs) exhibited overlapping patterns with similar intensities.
Morphological observations of AgNPs were conducted using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The SEM images of the optimized silver nanoparticles are presented in Fig. 5. The uniform granular topography was observed within the SEM images of four types of nanoparticles. Additionally, High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) was utilized to investigate nanoparticle size, shape, and morphology at high resolution (Dhaka et al., 2023). Which has revealed well-dispersed, predominantly spherical nanoparticles for all four types. HR-TEM analysis has confirmed that the NPs range in size from 5 to 30 nm (Fig. 6). The energy dispersive spectrum of each type of nanoparticle has indicated a predominant presence of silver. In addition to silver, elemental signals for C, N, O, S, Cl, and Cu were detected (Fig. 6(i). The presence of Cu signals was attributed to the Cu grids used for sample mounting, while other elemental signals were related to the biomaterial capping on the nanoparticles. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns for all four types of AgNPs showed variations in intensity but consistent fringe width of about 0.22 nm (Fig. S4), which h
as confirmed their crystalline nature as shown in Fig. 6.
