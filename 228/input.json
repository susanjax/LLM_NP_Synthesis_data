Synthesis of ZnO nanoparticle
0.13 M solution of Zinc Nitrate (Zn (NO3)2·6H2O) was prepared in deionized water. 1.3 M Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution was added drop wise with constant stirring at room temperature and heated on an oil bath at 50 °C for 90 min
[8]
. The solution was allowed to cool to the room temperature and the product obtained was separated by centrifugation, the ppt was washed with absolute ethanol 2–3 times, and dried at 40 °C in a hot air oven. The obtained product was characterized using XRD and FE-SEM.

The Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO Nps) were synthesized by precipitation method. The characterization of the synthesized ZnONp with respect to their morphology and structural properties was done by using XRD and FE-SEM (

 and

). XRD analysis was used to provide insight into the crystalline structure and crystallite size of particles. The XRd peaks at 2θ 31.8355o, 34.5207°, 36.2871°, 47.5808°, 56.648°, 62.8918° 66.4115°, 67.9331°, 69.1842° and 77.0106° corresponds to the (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (2 0 0), (1 1 2), (2 0 1) and (2 0 2) crystal planes and hexagonal crystal geometry. The average particle size of the nanoparticles was determined by using the Scherrer equation.
where D is the crystallite size of the particle, k represents the Scherrer constant which is equal to 0.9, λ is the wavelength of light used for diffraction (λ = 1.544 Å). β is the FWHM (full width at half maximum) of the diffraction peak and θ is the angle of reflection. The average size of the nanoparticles calculated from the XRD pattern was in the range 48–50 nm. From the SEM data the particle size was found to be 20–70 nm which is in agreement with XRD data.
