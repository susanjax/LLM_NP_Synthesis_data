Preparation of B-BTC framework
At first, the synthesis of the bi-organic framework was done via the solvothermal method following the formerly accepted method with certain modifications [
31
]. Essentially, a clear solution at ambient temperature was created by dissolving the H3BTC (1 g) and Bi(NO3)3.5H2O (0.4 g) in a 60 mL solution of methanol under continuous stirring. Before stirring, the mixture was then poured into a Teflon-lined steel autoclave and heated to 120 °C for 24 h. The reaction solution was opted for centrifugation, cooled to ambient temperature, and washed several times with ethanol before being dried at 60 °C for 12 h to produce the bi-organic framework material. The B-BTC organic framework catalyst was synthesized using the same outline, utilizing AgNO3 as a source of silver with desired molar ratio (Ag: Bi). The subsequent sample was stated as B-BTC organic framework.
Characterization
The structure and morphology of B-BTC were studied via FE-SEM and HR-TEM. The catalyst displays a sheet-like exterior, agglomerated upon one another with layered spheres attached to the sheet. The structure and appearance evidence of the framework were additionally considered in point. The magnified representations in 
Fig. 1
 (a) reveal that varying layers exist across the nano-regime and are aggregated by many sheets-like crystallites.

 (b) illustrates the HR-TEM revealed the B-BTC distinctively separated revealing homogenous morphology. The lattice fringes attained for (111) and (012) tally to the d-values of 0.24 and 0.36 nm, respectively [

The details about the surface charge and stability of the B-BTC framework can be revealed by zeta potential. The zeta sizer technique reveals the polydispersity, nanoparticle size, and dynamic size. The average particle size was revealed as 20 nm as showcased in 
Fig. 2
 (a). The polydispersity index (PI) of the framework was revealed to be 0.653, indicating the polydisperse nature of the synthesized catalyst. The value of zeta potential was revealed to be −36.9, area (%) of 38.0 with a 7.07 standard deviation (mV) showcased in 
Fig. 2
 (b). This can be addressed by the extremely high surface energy of the B-BTC suspensions.
To comprehend the phase purity with the structural crystallography of B-BTC, analysis for XRD was executed with incidence with Cu Kα rays. In
Fig. 3
 (b), the XRD pattern formed for B-BTC can be seen. The pattern of the B-BTC framework depicts intense peaks at 22.05°, 29.18°, 31.52°, 38.81°, and 45.23° coinciding with (003), (012), (200), (111), and (113), respectively, indicating the successful formation of B-BTC. The values correspond to the JCPDS card no. 01-087-0719 and JCPDS card no. 44–1246. The d-values corresponding to 0.24 and 0.36 nm of HRTEM matched well with the lattice fringes attained for (111) and (012), respectively, in XRD. Correspondingly, peaks of pure Ag and Bi also coincide with the peaks formed with B-BTC [
