synthesis of Titanium dioxide particles 
In the following,
the two step sol-gel preparation method used is described
detail. Nanocrystalline titanium dioxide was prepared by
employing citric acid route were saturated solution of
α-Dextrose used as a surfactant.
Two separate solutions were prepared. In first step:
titanium nitrate and citric acid are taken in 1:3 and are
thoroughly stirred using magnetic stirrer with ammonia
solution at 80˚C about 5-6 hrs. Ammonia solution is used
to maintain the pH 4 of solution. Finally a gel is formed.
In second step, saturated solution of alpha dextrose is
added and stirred for 1hr at 120˚C to the spongy type gel
of nanoscaled TiO2 formed. This spongy gel is ignited at
a temperature of about 300˚C for 1 hr. At this temperature a combustion process takes place in the spongy
gel containing citric acid a result of it we have nanostructured titanium dioxide. 
Characterization of Titanium dioxide particles
The nano size titanium dioxide is synthesized using citric
acid and alpha dextrose. The small nanometer scale TiO2
particles as seen in the Figure 1 will impose several
effects that govern its antibacterial action. The X-ray
diffraction pattern shows cubic peaks of TiO2, which
indicates the nanocrystalline nature of pure
nanostructured titanium dioxide and is shown in the
Figure 2. By comparing the XRD pattern standard JCPS
data (432-161) of TiO2, indicating the prominent peaks
corresponding to 2θ = 27˚
, 39˚
, 48˚
, 55˚
 and 63˚
 are due to
(110), (200), (112), (220) and (310) planes which indicates formation of
single phase titanium dioxide. The crystalline size of the
Titanium dioxide is calculated by using debye-scharrer
equation and it was found to be around 20 nm.
