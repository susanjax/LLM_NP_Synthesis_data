Production medium and silver nanoparticle synthesis
The mould was grown in Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ​ml YpSs broth (pH 5.5) and kept in BOD incubator under shaking condition at 45 ​°C for 3 days. Fungal biomass was filtered by Whatman No.1 filter paper discs and the obtained cell-free culture filtrate was further clarified using centrifugation at 10,000 ​rpm and 4 ​°C for 10 ​min. Then, culture filtrate was used to synthesize AgNPs by mixing 0.5 ​ml culture filtrate with 20 ​ml of 1 ​mM silver nitrate solution followed by incubation at room temperature (30 ​°C) for 4 ​h in the presence of white light. The resultant brown colour sample was scanned in the range of 300–600 ​nm by a UV–vis spectrophotometer.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern clearly showed the crystalline nature of silver nanoparticles [25]. Total five intense bands were observed and the main band of Ago was seen at 112 (Fig. 2 b). The average AgNPs particle size was calculated to be 40 ​nm by the Debey Scherrer formula:
where d is the mean crystallite size (nm), k is the shape factor (here k ​= ​0.89), λ is the X-ray wavelength (for a Ag Kα source wavelength is 1.54 ​Å), θ is the Bragg angle (2θ ​= ​29.8), and β is the full width at the half maxima (0.2 ​× ​3.14/180 radian).
The results are consistent with the similar peaks with earlier studies reporting equivalent diffraction peaks for silver nanoparticles [[24], [25], [26]]. The Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) revealed the size of AgNPs as 73 ​nm (Fig. 2c).
