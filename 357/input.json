 One-pot synthesis of copper nanoparticles
Copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) 30 mM was solubilized in 1 % polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solution, 10 % ascorbic acid solution; then pH was adjusted to 7 by NaOH solution. The mixture was then placed in an oven at 90 °C for 6 h until the color of the solution turned brown. The synthesis of nanoparticles using ascorbic acid as a protecting and reducing agent is a process that is non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and economical [34]. Milli-Q grade water was used for all solution preparation.

To evaluate the chemical composition, size, and morphology of the nanoparticle surfaces, SEM combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used.
EDS spectrum was useful for determining the elemental composition of the synthesized nanoparticles, showing signals at binding energies at 0.98, 8.09, and 8.99 keV, which confirmed the presence of copper [44]. EDS analysis exhibited a very homogeneous composition with an almost negligible presence of oxygen (Fig. 1b). Similar results were reported by Jayaramudu et al. [44] and Tokarek et al. [42].
The morphology of the nanoparticles observed by SEM showed polyhedral faceted crystalline NpCu with heterogeneous sizes as can be seen in Fig. 1c.
According to Guisbiers and Abudukelimu [45], for small particles, facets tend to form on the surface and then form a polyhedron. Metals usually have face-centered cubic crystalline structures (FCC).
Likewise, the formation of NpCu was confirmed by TEM microscopy. Fig. 1d shows micrographs obtained by TEM of nanoparticles in a solution of PVP, dispersed and without the formation of agglomerates. According to Cardenas et al. [15], colloidal Cu would be coated with a thin layer of PVP, thus masking the influence of van der Waals forces and avoiding particle agglomeration. PVP acts as a protective agent and probably the polymer wraps up the copper cluster via partial donation of oxygen lone pair from Cdouble bondO groups to the vacant orbitals of the copper cluster surface [40]. The size distribution of NpCu, shown in the histogram of Fig. 1e, exhibited an average size of 16.2 nm obtained by adjustment of a normal curve with the highest frequency comprised between 15 and 20 nm. The results were similar to those reported by Cardenas et al. [15] for polymeric matrices loaded with metal nanoparticles, which presented particle sizes between 5 and 10 nm.
The diffractograms obtained by XRD were analyzed with specific software X'Pert HighScore Plus. Using the software, the background was determined, and the peak parameters such as intensity, width, position, and shape were estimated. Furthermore, the crystallite size of the nanoparticles was calculated by using the Debye–Scherrer equation [23].

where,
D is the crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of the incident X-ray (λ = 0.1540 nm), K is the Scherrer constant (0.90), β is the full width at half maximum intensity in radians, θ is the Bragg diffraction angle in degrees.
The diffraction peak corresponding to the lattice planes (111), (200), and (220) were used for calculation because these peaks are well resolved and do not show any interferences (Fig. 1f and Table S3). The average crystallite size gives a value of 6 nm, it being similar to that observed by TEM.
The three peaks at 2θ values of 43.4, 50.5, and 74.2° corresponding to (111), (200), and (220) planes of copper were compared with the standard diffraction card of Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS), copper file No. 04–0836 (Supplementary material, Table S3) [46].
Small diffraction peaks located at 42.3° and 61.4° were assigned to the planes (200) and (220) distinctive of Cu2O nanoparticles (Fig. 1f). The presence of Cu2O indicates the partial oxidation of copper nanoparticles with dissolved oxygen in the solution during the drying process [47]. According to Khalid et al. [48], copper nanoparticles combined with the oxygen present in the ambient atmosphere forms an oxide layer on the particle surface when exposed to air.
