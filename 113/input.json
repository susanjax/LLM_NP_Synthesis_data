Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles
The AgNO3 required for the preparation of AgNP was ordered from QUALIZEN India Ltd., Mumbai. 100 ml of 1 mM AgNO3 aqueous solution was taken in RBF and 10 ml of methanolic extract was pipetted out and added while stirring continuously. A brown red colored solution was obtained after 4 h, which indicated the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. AgNPs were stored in Erlenmeyer flasks and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with agitation (200 rpm) [33]. During synthesis, a gradual change in color from transparent green to a reddish brown confirmed the presence of AgNPs. Fig. 2 (a–c) demonstrates the step-by-step process of the formation of AgNPs from plant extract and silver nitrate solution.
Characterization of silver nanoparticles
The absorption spectra of the synthesis process were performed at the beginning, after 15 min and after 24 h intervals at a wavelength range of 300–550 nm. As shown in Fig. 3, the AgNPs showed a prominent absorption peak between 408 and 412 nm, because of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) that is very perceptive to the size and shape of the nanoparticles. The SPR between 408 and 412 nm confirmed the spherical shape of the biosynthesized AgNPs [58], [59], [60]. After 24 h, the intensity of the absorption spectra elevated, which means there were more synthesized AgNPs [61,62].
The XRD pattern can be used to confirm the crystallinity of Ag-NPs generated after synthesis with O. griffithii extract. Fig. 5A showed the XRD peaks of O. griffithii extract, which reveal only amorphous peaks at 28.91° and no silver peaks. However, after the synthesis of AgNPs, there were five diffration peaks in the 2θ region of 38.12 o, 44.31°, 64.43°, and 77.39° showed in Fig. 5B, confirming the occurance of Miller indices (111, 200, 220, and 311) in a cubic lattice. This pattern is based on JCPDS No. 04-0873, the standard metallic silver XRD pattern. Using the Debye-Scherrer equation, the mean size of the synthesized AgNPs was estimated to be 30 nm, which is entirely consistent with the SEM results and UV–vis spectra [66]. The AgNPs were proven to have been synthesised in the presence of extract and have a face-centered cubic structure (FCC) [67].
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were done to determine the size of the AgNPs formed. The particle size distribution curve of the synthesized AgNPs is shown in Fig. 6. It showed various sizes of the particles, ranging from 6.521 nm to 350.42 nm, and had an average particle size of 151 nm. This value range indicated high agglomeration and precipitation of AgNPs. In continuation of this, the zeta potential value was determined as -19.7V ± 0.8 mV (Fig. 7), and the negative value indicated the stability of the nanoparticles and also confirmed their evaded agglomeration [68].
