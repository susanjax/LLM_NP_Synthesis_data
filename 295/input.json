 Synthesis of AuNPs@PV
10 mL of extract of P. vera was added to HAuCl4·3H2O solution (10 mL and 1 mM). The reaction mixture was warmed to 50 °C with steady stirring until a change of color (yellow to purple-red). The reduction reaction was completed after 30 min. This color change indicates the formation of gold nanoparticles (Au3+
Au0). A centrifuge (Centrifuge 5810R, Eppendorf, Germany) was used (6000 rpm and 20 min) to obtain gold nanoparticles. The obtained precipitate was washed with methanol and deionized water. Eventually, the final product was transferred to an oven (60 °C) for analysis and identification.

The crystalline nature and purity of AuNPs@PV were assessed by the XRD analysis (XRD; Philips X'pert PRO; Netherlands). AuNPs@PV illustrated four Bragg’s diffraction patterns placed at 2θ angles: 38.20°, 44.22°, 64.79°, 77.67° which are related to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1). Accordingly, it suitable matches the face cubic structure of AuNPs (JCPDS card No 04–0784), as depicted in
Fig. 4
. Previous studies also report similar XRD patterns for synthesized gold nanoparticles (
Ebrahimzadeh et al., 2020
).

The morphology and structure of AuNPs@PV were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, and the results are illustrated in
Fig. 5
. The intrinsic properties of nanoparticles rely on their size, shape and dispersion. It has also been proven that the high content of phenolic compounds surrounding the green synthesized nanoparticles leads to the creation of larger-sized particles (
Rahman et al., 2019
). FESEM and TEM micrographs (
Fig. 5
 a and b) revealed that the AuNPs@PV was mostly spherical-like morphology, homogeneous, and regular arrangement with a size ranging from 20 to 35 nm. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrometer as an elemental analytical technique was used to determine the purity and elemental compositions of products. The EDS spectrum of AuNPs@PV was illustrated in
Fig. 6
. Due to surface plasmon resonance, the AuNPs@PV revealed a typical optical absorption peak at ∼3 KeV and other impurities are attributed to phytochemicals surrounding the surface of AuNPs@PV which leads to the stabilization of biosynthesized nanoparticles. The same result was acquired by Paul et al. (
Paul et al., 2014
), and Hamelian et al. (
Hamelian et al., 2018
).
