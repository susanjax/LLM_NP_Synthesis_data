Synthesis of halloysite based silver/POM nanocomposites
Halloysite nanotubes without any modification were dispersed in 0.1 M silver nitrate ethanol solution, kept for 1 h with magnetic stirring, centrifuged at 4000 g, and dried at 70 °C overnight. Then the obtained sample was placed in 0.01 M ethanol solution of the corresponding POM for 2 h, centrifuged, and dried at 70 °C.
Phosphomolybdic acid (PMA), phosphotungstic acid (PTA), and tungstosilicic acid (STA) were used as polyoxometalates (POM). The scheme of synthesis of the studied materials is presented in Fig. 1. At the first stage, nanocomposite with halloysite and silver nanoparticles (HNT-Ag) was obtained with AgNPs of 2.6 ± 0.9 nm diameter formed inside and outside the halloysite nanotubes (Fig. 2). The obtained HNT-Ag was then loaded with various POMs.
