Bio-green synthesis of silver nanoparticles
In the preparation of silver nanoparticles samples, AgNO3 (0.17 g) was first dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water and mix 95 ml with 5 ml of Aloe vera extract solution, incubate for 30 min at 60 °C. Silver nanoparticles was observed after about 30 min which was indicated by change in color of the solution from colorless to brownish yellow and red, respectively. The formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed by UV– visible spectroscopy. The silver nanoparticles was purified by frequent centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 25 min, washed with double-distilled water, and were redispersed in deionized water for further characterizations.
As shown in Fig. 2, the X-ray diffraction pattern of the produced silver nanoparticles was taken. All of the sample's diffraction peaks demonstrated that the silver nanocrystalline production was pure and the same as the hexagonal phase with Wurtzite structures.
HR-TEM analysis
By TEM examination, the crystalline properties and size of the produced nanoparticles can be estimated. Fig. 3 demonstrates photos at various magnifications (50 and 100 nm) taken with the JEOL-2100. TEM photographs exhibit particle sizes ranging from 9.26 to 31.18 nm. Otherwise, it confirmed the hexagonal structure of the synthesized silver nanoparticles.
