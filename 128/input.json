Synthesis of AgNPs
AgNPs were synthesized using the methodology reported by Ullah et al. [40]. Briefly, the AgNPs were successfully synthesized using the leaf extracts of three different Ophiorrhiza species separately. Briefly, 20 mL of each plant extract was added in a drop-wise manner (20 min) to the 100 mL aqueous solution of AgNO3 (1 mM) with continuous stirring for 60 min at 80 °C. For complete bio-reduction, the resulting liquor was preserved for 24 h at room temperature. After 24 h, the solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min. The paste obtained was washed three times to eliminate any contaminants and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The product (AgNPs) was then stored in a sealed glass vial, and reserved in a desiccator until needed. The samples are denoted as Om-AgNPs, Oh-AgNPs and Or-AgNPs for the Om-, Oh- and Or-mediated plant extract, respectively.
Characterization of AgNPs
Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of Or-AgNPs, Om-AgNPs and Oh-AgNPs synthesized nanoparticles by three Ophiorrhiza species extract. The diffraction peaks of the Or-AgNPs, Om-AgNPs and Oh-AgNPs were observed close to 28°, 32°, 38°, 44°, 46°, 55°, 57°, 64° and 77° in the 2θ range of 20°–80°, which can be ascribed to the (210), (122), (111), (200), (231), (142), (241), (220) and (311) silver crystalline planes of face-centered cubic structure (JCPDS, file No. 04–0783).
The crystallite size of AgNPs has been calculated using the Debye-Scherrer equation [46]:
where, D is the average crystallite size, k is the geometric factor (0.9), λ is the wavelength of X-ray radiation source (0.15406 nm) and β is the FWHM (full-width at half maximum) of the XRD peak at the diffraction angle θ and the results are presented in Table 1. The average crystallite size of Om-AgNPs, Oh-AgNPs and Or-AgNPs were 16 nm, 20 nm and 28 nm, respectively.
The morphology and size of synthesized AgNPs were identified using SEM and TEM analysis. Spherical agglomerates with variable sizes were found during SEM analysis (Fig. 5a–c). TEM images of synthesized AgNPs are shown in Fig. 6 a. The images also show spherical shapes with variable sizes. The particle size distribution graph (Fig. 6 b) shows the average size of Om-AgNPs, Oh-AgNPs and Or-AgNPs to be approximately 17 ± 5 nm, 22 ± 9 nm and 26 ± 10 nm, respectively, which is in well agreement with the calculated size from XRD (16 nm, 20 nm and 28 nm) and SPR band (18 nm, 22 nm 26 nm) analysis. The SAED pattern (Fig. 6 c) showed that the diffraction rings might be indexed as (210), (122), (111), (200), (231), (142), (241), (220), and (311) reflections, which correspond to face-centered cubic polycrystalline silver from inner to outer with minimal variations in d-spacing.
