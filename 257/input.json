Preparation of silver nanoparticle
The freshly collected P. biglandulosa leaves were washed several times with ordinary tap water to eliminate the dust particles, if any. The leaves were finally washed with purified water and were dried in a hot air oven at 50 ​°C overnight. The dried leaves were crushed and ground in a mixer grinder and mixed with sterilized distilled water. This was filtered through a Whatman No.1 filter paper to obtain the leaf extract. AgNPs of 80 ​mM were synthesized by dissolving 0.475g of silver nitrate in 35 ​ml of aqueous solution of the above prepared P. biglandulosa leaf extract. The reaction mixture was continuously stirred until a colour change was observed from yellowish-brown to greyish-brown. The reaction mixture was irradiated with microwave irradiation for about 120 ​s and the colour of the extract turned to dark brown colour [

]. Tyndall effect was observed in the presence of light.
2.3. Chemical synthesis of AgNPs (cAgNPs) by using sodium borohydride as reducing agent
One hundred ml of 1 ​mM of AgNO3was added slowly into 100 ​ml of 4 ​mM of NaBH4 solution. The reaction mixture was stirred until the appearance of grey color that indicated the formation of AgNPs.

TEM images confirmed that the PbAgNPs were found to be predominately spherical in shape. They were found to be monodispersed having an average particle size of 15 ​nm. At low resolution, the silver nanoparticles were well separated from each other with a uniform interparticle separation as shown in
Fig. 3
(c). The surface of the silver nanoparticles was coated with an organic layer that was indicated by the HRTEM image as seen in
Fig. 3
(a and b). As confirmed from the FTIR analysis the phytomolecules such as flavonoids, alcoholic and phenolic compounds, tannins, terpenoids and glycosides were responsible for the reduction of Ag+ ions and the stabilization of the surface of the NPs. The majority of the particles are not in contact with each other but are separated by an organic layer. Hence the nanoparticles were well dispersed in the bio-reduced aqueous solution [

]. The selected area electron diffraction pattern explained the crystalline nature of the PbAgNPs. The bright circular spots indicated that the particles were single crystalline in nature as shown in
