 Nanoparticle synthesis
The synthesis of AgNPs involved the addition of 2 g of powdered clove leaves to 20 mL of distilled water, followed by filtration to obtain the crude extract, also known as the aqueous extract. Next, introduce 20 mL of the precursor solution (containing silver nitrate), subject it to a temperature of 80Â°C for a duration of 65 min, and maintain continuous stirring during the process. Subsequently, let the solution to remain in darkness for a duration of 24 h, and subsequently analyze any alterations in coloration, as this will serve as an indication of the existence of nanoparticles through the utilization of plant extract. To confirm the existence of nanoparticles, additional analysis of the UV spectrum was conducted by examining the peaks. (
