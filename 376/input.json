Preparation of strawberry seed (SS) extract
Strawberry fruit was purchased from Swat, Pakistan. To obtain the seeds from the fruit, strawberries were washed to remove the dust particles then peeled the outer cover of all the strawberries that is rich of seeds and dried undershed for one week. Then dried strawberry seeds (SS) were washed with ethanol several times to dislodge the unwanted compounds and oven dried again at 50 °C to remove moisture/ solvent content. Seeds were then grinded into fine powder with the help of mortar and pestle and then stored the powder into stoppered bottles to avoid moisture. Different amount (0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 g) of SS powder was added 20 mL of distilled water. Extract was prepared by placing the mixture at orbital shaker for two hours at 200 rpm speed. The resulting solution was filtered using watt man filter paper and concentrated using rotary evaporator.

Fabrication of Ag NPs using SS extract
Strawberry seed (SS) extract (7 mL) was taken followed by addition of 20 mL distilled water and stirring for 15 min. 14 mL of AgNO3 solution (0.01427 g of AgNO3 in 70 mL distilled water) was added dropwise in seed extract with continuous stirring on the magnetic hot plate for 2 h. Color change was prominent at optimum pH of 8.4. The resulting solution was centrifuged for 30–35 min at 4200 rpm. Solution and solid Ag NPs samples were separated and the solid was dried in oven. Solution stored in sample vials and solid products were stored.
To check the morphology of silver nanoparticles SEM analysis was done and micrograph was obtained, shown in Fig. 3. For this purpose, sample was dried in oven and solid samples were observed over NOVA FE-SEM 450. Size distribution from this micrograph was estimated and mostly the particles were ranging from 50 nm to 70 nm. All the particles had spherical morphology, which prolificly acted as catalyst due to greater surface area [47]. Ag NPs stabilized by SS extract were analyzed using EDX to confirm its element percent compostion and Ag presence Fig. 4). The results revealed that sample contains highest percentage of silver, highlighted on SEM micrograph as well and confirms the fabrications of Ag NPs.
XRD studies (Fig. 5) were done for the evaluation of crystallinity in the Ag NPs. The peaks having different intensity were obtained at 2θ = 38.11°, 44.27°, 64.42° and 77.42°. Results revealed that Ag NPs are cubic having crystallite size (D) 2.11 nm. The JCPDS number for cubic Ag NPs was 04–0784 (Table 2).
