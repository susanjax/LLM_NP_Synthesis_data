Synthesis of the hybrid nanoparticles
CS–PE–AuNPs were synthesized by mixing 2.5 mL of Punica granatum L. extract (PE) with Chitosan (CS) solution to get a final volume of 50 mL. The mixture was stirred for 2 h until being homogeneous and then heated to 80 °C. Thereafter, a suitable amount of HAuCl4.3H2O solution was added in order to get a final concentration of 1.25 mmol/L. The resulting mixture was then heated for 15 min after which it was cooled. CS–AuNPs and PE–AuNPs were synthesized by following the same procedure but without the addition of PE and CS, respectively.
Characterization of nanoparticles
TEM imaging was performed to investigate the shape, size and the efficiency of coating of the prepared NPs. The images in Fig. 4 show that the as prepared NPs are spherical in shape with smooth surfaces in all cases. The insets depict magnified particles demonstrating a central metallic gold core and a circumferential polymeric layer representing the coating polymer (CS and/or PE). It is clear from the histograms (Fig. 4d–f) that the average particle sizes obtained from the TEM images are 16.9 ± 2.0, 25.0 ± 4.0 and 34.1 ± 5.9 nm for CS–AuNPs, PE–AuNPs and CS–PE–AuNPs, respectively. However, the particle size distribution obtained from DLS measurements is usually more accurate and can be used for studying the variations in the physicochemical properties of the NPs more conveniently.
By investigating the morphological characteristics of CS–AuNPs, PE–AuNPs and CS–PE–AuNPs with the aid of the scanning electron microscope, it was found that most of the hybrid NPs show spherical shapes (Fig. 5).
XRD analysis is very useful in the analysis of samples containing metallic constituents. In this context, XRD analysis was performed for all studied hybrid NPs (Fig. 6a). The analysis results depict the presence of the four characteristic XRD peaks of AuNPs at 38.02, 44.30, 64.80 and 77.70° corresponding to the standard Bragg reflections (111), (200), (220) and (311) of face–centered cubic gold lattice (Krishnamurthy, Esterle, Sharma, & Sahi, 2014).
