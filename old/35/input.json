Synthesis and characterization of AuNPs
For the genesis of AuNPs, 10 mL of PG extract was combined with 90 mL of HAuCl4 (1 mM) and allowed to react at room temperature (RT); the colour of the reaction mixture varied over the incubation period, indicating the synthesis of AgNPs. 
The synthesis of AuNPs was affirmed by a colour change, which was further validated by UV–vis spectra with a maximum absorption peak at 527 nm. Bandgap energy was calculated as 2.13 eV by Tauc method from the UV result. The presence of amino acids and proteins in PG was responsible for the conversion of gold ions to AuNPs, according to FTIR analysis. (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystallographic planes were observed by XRD; further crystalline nature was validated by SAED analysis. The size and zeta value were found to be 53.29 nm and -9.8 mV respectively. Spherical shaped nanoparticles and elemental structure of PG-AuNPs were confirmed by HRTEM and EDS analysis.
XRD is primarily used to identify phases and characterize the crystalline nature of PG-AuNPs. Fig. 5. illustrates the face-centered cubic (FCC) AuNPs because of XRD analysis, which is agreed with the FCC structure referenced in joint committee of powder diffraction standard (JCPDS) card no. 04-0784 [22]. Furthermore, the XRD peaks at 2θ of 38.30°, 44.67°, 64.57°, and 78.76° might be assigned to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystallographic planes, indicating that the PG-AuNPs are cubic crystalline. 
The hydrodynamic size and zeta potential of nanoparticles are significant features for future uses in nanoparticle research. The hydrodynamic size was determined to be 53.29 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.354, as illustrated in Fig. 6(a).
HRTEM analysis was used to evaluate the morphology of gold nanoparticles [26]. The image of PG-AuNPs with a spherical shape was given in Fig. 7(a–i),
