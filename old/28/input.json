Synthesis of silver nanoparticles
AgNPs with diameters of 28 nm (AgNP-28 nm) and 8 nm (AgNP-8 nm) were synthesised through the reduction of complex cation [Ag(NH3)2]+ by D-maltose (Sivera et al., 2014) and sodium borohydride, respectively. Detailed description of synthetic procedures and characterisation techniques is included in the Appendix: Supplementary material.

All experiments were carried out at room temperature (approx. 21 °C). The final concentrations of reagents for preparation AgNP-28nm were as follows: silver nitrate 1·10-3 mol/L, ammonia 5·10-3 mol/L, sodium hydroxide 9.6·10-3 mol/L and D-maltose 1·10-2 mol/L. 

In case of AgNP-8nm, the final concentrations of reaction components were as follows: silver nitrate 1·10-2 mol/L, ammonia 5·10-2 mol/L, sodium borohydride 2·10-2 mol/L.

AgNPs with a diameter of 28 nm (AgNP-28nm) were synthesised through the reduction of complex cation [Ag(NH3)2]+ by D-maltose in alkaline media (pH 11.5) (Sivera et al., 2014). Gelatin was added to the prepared AgNP dispersion at final concentrations of 0.05% or 0.1% for Müller-Hinton (MH, Oxoid) or brain-heart infusion (BHI, Oxoid) broths, respectively, to prevent aggregation of AgNPs in the bacterial culture media.
AgNPs with a diameter of 8 nm (AgNP-8nm) were synthesised through the reduction of complex cation [Ag(NH3)2]+ by sodium borohydride in the presence of polyacrylic acid (PAA), which was used at a final concentration of 0.18% as a stabiliser and was added into the dispersion prior to the addition of the reducing substance.
AgNPs with an average size of 28 nm or 8 nm (based on DLS measurements) were synthesised on the basis of the different reducing power of the reducing agents used. A preliminary estimate of the average size of synthesised AgNPs was determined using the DLS technique and subsequently verified using TEM. TEM images revealed spherical AgNPs with mean diameter of 20.6 nm (range 10-30 nm) for AgNPs prepared using D-maltose and 4.7 nm (range 2-18 nm) for AgNPs prepared using sodium borohydride (Fig. S1A and S2A).
