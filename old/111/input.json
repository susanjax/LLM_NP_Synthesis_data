Synthesis
A sol–gel synthesis technique was utilized for the preparation of the pure Ag2S and 10 % Cu-doped Ag2S (Cu/Ag2S) NPs. To synthesize pure Ag2S NPs, 20 mL of 1.950 g of Na2S aqueous solution was added drop by drop to 60 mL of 8.491 g Ag(NO3) solution at 70 °C with vigorous stirring. After adding 20 mL NMP and the solution temperature is raised to 80 °C and maintained for 4 h to obtain a blackish thick gel. This resultant gel was cleaned multiple times with distilled water and ethanol separately along with their mixture. After drying in an oven set to 70°, the wet precipitate was then ground up for 20 min and calcined for 2 h at the temperature of 400 °C to eliminate volatile impurities and increase the crystallinity. Finally, the sample was reground for 30 min for homogeneity of the material (Kumari et al., 2014).

Further, for the synthesis of Cu/Ag2SNPs: both 8.067 g of AgNO3, and 0.603 g of Cu(NO3)2 were completely dissolved in 60 mL doubly ionised distilled water, and 1.951 g of Na2S in 20 mL distilled water was prepared separately to achieve the aqueous solution. 20 mL solution of Na2S was added dropwise to 60 mL solution of Ag(NO3) and Cu(NO3)2 at 70 °C and mixed with 20 mL NMP solution. The magnetic stirring of this solution at 80 °C for 4 h produced a blackish-thick gel. This thick gel was washed with water and ethanol and dried at 70 °C for 20 min. The final power was reground for 30 min after calcining at 400 °C for 2 h (Kumari et al., 2014).

Structural analysis
The crystallographic structure was investigated using XRD data (Shimadzu LabX XRD-6100 x-ray diffractometer) for both Ag2S and Cu/Ag2S powder NPs as shown in Fig. 1 (a, b). After scanning the diffraction pattern from 20° to 80°, numerous notable peaks appeared within the selected range. The prominent diffraction peaks are observed at 26°, 29°, 31.5°, 33.8°, 34.5°, 36.7°, 38°, 40.8°, 43.4°, 44.5°, 46.3°, 48.5°, 53.3°, 58.2°, and 64° in pure Ag2S sample, attribute to the respective ( −1 0 1), (1 1 1), ( −1 1 2), (1 2 0), ( −1 2 1), (1 2 1), ( −1 0 3), (0 3 1), (2 0 0), (0 2 3), (1 1 3), (21–2), (22–2), (0 4 2) and (0 3 4) planes, belonging to the presence of monoclinic Ag2S crystal structure phase. The lattice parameters, a = 4.219 Å and c = 7.852 Å as matched with the ICDD-JCPDS file number: 00–014-0072 (Hamed et al., 2020). While Cu-doped Ag2S sample has ( −1 0 1), ( −1 1 2), ( −1 2 1), ( −1 0 3), (0 3 1), (21–2), (22–2), (0 4 2) and (0 3 4) Miller planes at their respective 2θ values. The Ag2S phase purity in the Cu-doped Ag2S sample can be described based on the lack of any diffraction peak associated with copper oxide phases. The lattice parameters for Cu/Ag2S were a = 4.208 Å and c = 7.841 Å for Cu/Ag2S. As obtained from Fig. 1 (c), the breadth of the most intense plane peak ( −1 0 3) is somewhat wider and displaced for higher 2θ values for Cu/Ag2S, which can be ascribed to the fact that the lattice parameters and crystallite size have decreased. The average crystallite/grain size is evaluated from XRD peaks using the Debye-Scherrer equation to be 42 nm and 23 nm for pure Ag2S and Cu-doped Ag2S NPs, respectively.
The image acquired from SEM revealed the irregular-sized spherical NPs of Ag2S as shown in Fig. 3(a). Cu-doped Ag2S material shows the same morphology, but contains some specific agglomeration of NPs (Fig. 3(b)). The observed particle size of Cu/Ag2S is smaller than that of pure Ag2S NPs as can be seen in the micrograph. In addition, the EDX spectra as depicted in Fig. 3(c) and (d) were analyzed, which demonstrated that the Ag2S NPs contain the elemental components of both Ag and S and Ag, S & O in Cu/Ag2S NPs, respectively. The elemental compositions are presented in the table format as atomic % and weight % together with individual elements bar graphs (Fig. 3c and 3d).
