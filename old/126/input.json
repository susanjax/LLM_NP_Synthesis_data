 Synthesis of CuO NPs
20 g CuSO4.5H2O was dissolved in 100 ml DI water in which 10 ml leaf extract was added. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 9 by adding NaOH. The mixture was then subjected to heating at 80 °C and stirring was maintained at 400 rpm for 60 min. The completion of the reaction was visually observed by tracking the change of color of the solution from initial bluish green to brownish black within 60 min, indicating the formation of CuO Nps. After cooling down to room temperature, the solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min and filtered. Remaining residue was collected and washed several times with DI water followed by absolute ethanol. After washing several times, the residual solid CuO NPs was dried in an oven at 60 °C for 5 h. The synthesis scheme of Averrhoa carambola extract mediated CuO NPs is shown in Fig. 1.
Characterization of CuO NPs
The XRD pattern shown in Fig. 2 depicts the orientation and crystalline structure of the Averrhoa carambola L. extract mediated green synthesized CuO NPS. The pattern shows a series of diffraction peaks at 2θ angles of 32.15°, 35.64°, 38.69°, 48.81°, 52.72°, 58.10°, 61.72°, 66.08° and 68.40° which corresponds to the (110), (−111), (111), (202), (020), (202), (−113), (−311) and (113) crystal planes respectively. Such findings are in harmony with the previous literatures [34,52,53]. The pattern has the best match with the ICDD (International Centre for Diffraction Data) card no #01-080-1268 [54,55]. The presence of two sharpest peaks within the 2θ diffraction angle of 35° and 39° confirms the formation of monoclinic structured CuO NPs [44].
