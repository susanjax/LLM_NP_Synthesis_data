Synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles
1.3 M solution of Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was added drop wise to 0.13 M solution of Zinc nitrate (Zn (NO3)2·6H2O) at room temperature with constant stirring. This mixture was heated on an oil bath at 50 °C for 90 min [11]. This solution was allowed to cool to room temperature and centrifuged, the precipitate of separates out. Absolute ethanol was used to double wash the obtained precipitate and the product was dried at 40 °C in a hot air oven. The characterization of the product was done using XRD and FE-SEM.
characterization
The precipitation method was employed to synthesize the Zinc oxide nanoparticles. The characterization of the synthesized ZnONp with respect to their morphology and structural properties was done by using XRD and FE-SEM (Figs. 1 and 2). XRD analysis was used to provide insight into the crystalline structure and crystallite size of particles.The XRd peaks at 2θ 31.8355o,34.5207o, 36.2871° 47.5808°, 56.648°, 62.8918° 66.4115°, 67.9331°, 69.1842° and 77.0106° corresponds to the (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (2 0 0), (1 1 2), (2 0 1) and (2 0 2) crystal planes and hexagonal crystal geometry. The average particle size of the nanoparticles was determined by using the Scherrer equation.
Where D is the crystallite size of the particle, k represents the Scherrer constant which is equal to 0.9, λ is the wavelength of light used for diffraction (λ = 1.544 Å). β is the FWHM (full width at half maximum) of the diffraction peak and θ is the angle of reflection. The average size of the nanoparticles calculated from the XRD pattern was in the range 48–50 nm.From the SEM data the particle size was found to be 20–70 nm which is in agreement with XRD data.
