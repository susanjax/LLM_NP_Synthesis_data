Biosynthesis and characterization of gold nanoparticles
The cell filtrate was mixed with 2.5 mM HAuCL4
 (Sigma
Aldrich) in ratio 10:1 for 24 hours at 37c with agitation 120 rpm,
the cell filtrate, and the HAuCL4
 solution was kept under the same
conditions. Changing color from yellow to violet to pink refers to
the formation of AuNPs and to confirm that we used UV-visible
Spectrophotometer (T80) operated with 1 nm resolution.
AuNPs characterization
In this study, stable AuNPs were produced in solution
by the extracellular fluid of Pleurotus ostreatus fungus. Different
intracellular and extracellular methods are used for the production
of biological nanoparticles. The
colloidal suspensions of AuNPs were collected then examined by
XRD which show crystalline nature of AuNPs (Figure 5). FCC
structured of gold show 4 sets of the lattice (111, 200, 220, and
311). These values also reported for gold nanostructures (Du et
al., 2007; Deplanche and Macaskie, 2008) an agreement with the
database (Wang et al., 1994). The TEM micrographs visualize
the size and shape of AuNPs formed (Figure 6a,b) which show
that the particles are uneven in a spherical shape with a varying
size of 10-30 nm.
