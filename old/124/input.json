Synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs)
ZnO NPs were prepared using the plant leaf extract of Ficus palmata. After the plant extract preparation as described above, 1 M of zinc acetate was dissolved in 50 ml of Milli-Q water and allowed to stand on magnetic stirrer for 1 h continuously. After this, 20 ml of sodium hydroxide solution was added drop wise into the zinc acetate solution. To this solution, 25 ml of plant extract solution was added. The above solution was left for stirring for 2 h at 35–40 °C at pH 12. The formation of yellow color after the incubation, confirmed the ZnO NPs. The precipitate was obtained from the reaction solution by centrifugation at 8000 rpm at 60 °C for 15 min and pellet was collected and dried [32].
Characterization of green synthesized nanoparticles (ZnO NPs)
The particle size distribution profile of synthesized nanoparticles by dynamic light scattering methods. The size distribution profile of nanoparticles is represented in Fig. 3. A narrow size distribution at room temperature was observed, which confirmed the synthesis of nanoparticles. In the case of nanoparticles synthesized using Ficus palmata leaf extracts, the average particle size was observed to be 35 nm. These studies also determined the hydrodynamic diameter of the synthesized nanoparticles. These results also suggested that there is an absence of large aggregates, when these nanoparticles were dispersed in aqueous medium and its supports previous report [50], [51].
To study the surface morphology and shape of the synthesized nanoparticles, FESEM studies were done and is represented inFig. 5. Its show highly dense ZnO NPs with surface morphology, which revealed the encapsulation of the plant extracts with zinc. FESEM images were scanned in the magnification range of 1 µm (70000 X) and clearly demonstrated the presence of agglomerated and high dispersed nanostructures with great crystallinity and some spherical shaped structures of synthesized nanoparticles. It also shows the non-smooth, but spherical morphology of both the nanoparticles. Due to the high surface energy present on the surface of nanoparticles, it was found that ZnO NPs lead to the agglomeration. The obtained results supported the previous studies carried out on the synthesis of ZnO NPs [53], [54].
