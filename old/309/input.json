Synthesis of Ag NPs
The protocol included the preparation of 8 ml of plant (Capsicum annuum) extract and an aqueous solution, 0.01 mM, of Ag NO3. Then, the Capsicum annuum extract was added to 16 mL of 0.01 mM Ag NO3 solution. The color of the solution (plant extract and Ag(I) ions) varied from light yellow to dark brown after 18 min, which indicates the reduction of pure Ag(I) ions to Ag(0). This change in color of the prepared solution was a sign of silver nanoparticles’ production. The prepared solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min, and the solid products were washed with distilled water four times to remove any AgNO3 residues. After optimization, the silver nanoparticles were dried to obtain a fine powder. Finally, prepared Ag NPs were identified using TEM and XRD analysis
2.3. Prepared of Se NPs
0.8 g of sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) was stirred with 50 ml of distilled water, and 0.8 g of albumin was stirred into 40 ml of the solvent. Then, these solutions were mixed at ambient temperature for 120 min until the color changed to red. This difference indicates the generation of Se NPs, with continuous stirring for ∼4 h to complete the reduction. After that, the product was incubated for 12 h, and the prepared solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 60 min. At last, the as-prepared Se NPs were identified using TEM and XRD analysis.

2.4. Synthesis of PVA/SA/Ag–Se nanocomposite samples
To prepare each polymeric sample, 0.35 gm of PVA and 0.15 gm of SA were dissolved together in 60 ml of distilled water. The polymeric mixture solutions were stirred continuously at 55 °C for 6 h once until a homogeneous viscous liquid was obtained. Then, Ag–Se NPs (50/50 %) were filled with different concentrations (0.00, 010, 0.20, 0.50, and 1.00 wt%) and sonicated into the PVA/SA blend. The PVA/SA nanocomposite films were prepared via solution casting way. The solutions of all nanocomposites were poured onto plastic dishes and dried in the oven at 45 °C for 72 h.

Characterization
Structural studies
TEM images and size distribution histograms elucidate the sizes and shapes of silver and selenium nanoparticles, as shown in
Fig. 1
. The sizes of the silver nanoparticles were about 9.68–32.18 nm (
Fig. 1
a), and they appeared to be spherical in shape without any aggregation.
Fig. 1
b displays a TEM image and the histogram of prepared Se NPs characterization. It is clear from this figure that Se NPs were created with spherical nanoparticle shapes, having diameters ranging from 12.72 to 22.82 nm [

]. Also, a relatively uniform film with agglomeration orientation was formed from Se NPs without forming aggregates [

].

XRD patterns of the prepared nanoparticles of Ag–Se and the nanocomposite samples were recorded for the range of 5–70° are shown in
Fig. 2
. Three main peaks at 2θ = 38.06, 44.23, and 64.39ᵒ in the XRD pattern of silver nanoparticles were identified to Ag element and correspond respectively to (hkl) value (111), (200) and (220) planes of Ag NPs [
28
]. The diffraction scan of Ag NPs was compared to the standard powder diffraction card of JCPDS no. 04-0783 [
29
]. These results proved that the particles produced in this sample are Ag NPs with a face-centered cubic crystal structure.
