SNPs with different sizes were synthesized according to the literatures [8], [26]. In order to compare the cellular uptake performance of various SNPs and study the corresponding intracellular uptake mechanisms, FITC was covalently linked to the surface of SNPs for fluorescence detection. TEM and SEM images of FITC functionalized SNPs (FITC–SNPs) are shown in Fig. 1. By measuring the diameters of 100 individual SNPs directly from the TEM images, the narrow size distributions of approximately 55.6 nm (SNPs-55.6), 167.8 nm (SNPs-167.8), and 307.6 nm (SNPs-307.6) are presented in Fig. 2a–c. Comparatively, DLS analyses showed that the diameters of the three SNPs in phosphate buffer solutions (PBS, pH=7.4) are centered at 61.8 nm, 164.2 nm, and 342.0 nm (Fig. 2d), which are slightly larger than the results obtained from TEM images except that of SNPs-167.8. This is reasonable because hydrodynamic diameters are generally larger than the core nanoparticle sizes observed by TEM [23].
Since previous data revealed that the surface charge can not only affect the ability of SNPs to internalize cells and escape endosomal entrapment [21] but also the corresponding cellular uptake mechanisms [20], [21], the surface charges on the three SNPs were measured to check the uniformity of this parameter. Table 1 shows the Zeta potentials for various SNPs suspended in PBS before and after the surface modification with FITC. When compared with those of SNPs-55.6 and SNPs-167.8, the Zeta potential of SNPs-307.6 is a little more negative. This small difference can be attributed to the condensation of silanol groups of hydrated SNPs-55.6 and SNPs-167.8 during the calcination process [24]. After modification with FITC, the surface charges on FITC–SNPs increase slightly due to the presence of amino groups (from APTMS used to treat SNPs surface) which are not linked to FITC. In general, the surface charges are similar for FITC–SNPs of different sizes at the physiological pH. Fig. 3 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the SNPs before and after the surface modification with FITC. The total pore volumes decrease slightly due to the surface functionalization. The SAXS patterns are also presented in the supporting information (Fig. S1).
