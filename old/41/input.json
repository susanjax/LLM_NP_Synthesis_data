synthesis of AuNPs
Cell pellets (250 mg, wet weight) of D. radiodurans obtained from cell culture as described were washed three times with deionized water, followed by incubation with 1 mM Au(III) solution at 32°C and pH 7.0 for 8 h. The resulting purple-colored solution was centrifuged at 8,000× g for 10 min to separate and collect the cell pellet and supernatant, respectively. The cell pellet was washed with deionized water until the supernatant was colorless. The supernatants were combined, filtered using 0.22 μm syringe filters and then dialyzed against ultrapure water for 48 h with agitation.
Characterization of AuNPs from D. radiodurans
The morphology, size and distribution of the synthesized AuNPs were analyzed by SEM and TEM. SEM images showed that AuNPs were accumulated as bright particles on the surface of D. radiodurans cells in 1 or 5 mM Au(III) (Figure 2A and B); this was confirmed by EDXA of the cell surface of D. radiodurans (Figure 2C), which revealed the presence of characteristic peaks for Au along with trace peaks for C, N, O, P and S. In the SEM images, the AuNPs were of spherical, pseudo-spherical, truncated triangular and irregular shapes which were observed on the cell surface (Figure 2A and B) and were more evident in the image of the prepared AuNPs from the cell supernatant (Figure 2D).
To characterize the crystallite nature of AuNPs, XRD analysis of lyophilized AuNPs was conducted. The face-centered cubic structure of atomic gold crystals was represented by the intense diffraction peaks from the AuNPs (Figure 3A), confirming the crystalline nature of the AuNPs. The peaks appeared at 38.27°, 44.37°, 64.54°, 77.80° and 81.74° in the 2θ range of 20°–90°, corresponding to the characteristic diffractions of the (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) planes of the face-centered cubic Au structure, respectively. 
The hydrodynamic particle size and zeta potential of AuNPs were further measured using the Zetasizer Nano ZS. As shown in Figure 3B, the formed AuNPs were highly monodispersed, and the average size of the AuNPs was 43.75 nm while the size of the highest percentage of AuNPs (13.55%) was 39.5 nm, which matched with the size of nanoparticles observed by SEM and TEM and estimated by XRD.
