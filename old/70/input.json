Bioinspired fabrication of iron oxide nanoparticles
In the fabrication of Fe2O3 NPs the leaf extract of achyranthes aspera is taken in to a 15 mL beaker and added 10 mL of ferric chloride and 10 mL of ferric sulfate heptahydrate. This beaker is placed on the magnetic stirrer for the proper mixing of the solution. The temperature of the magnetic stirrer is set at 50 °C and the RPM is set at 350–400. The pH of the solution is maintained at 9. For the basic medium a few drops of NaOH is used in the mixture [23,24]. This stirring is continuous for about 4 h. After 4 h the color of the mixture changes from green to brown. The color change of the mixture indicates that the iron oxide nanoparticles are prepared. In the preparation of Fe2O3 NPs muffle furnace is used and the temperature of the muffle furnace is set at the 500 °C. The crucible is placed into the muffle furnace for about 10 min. When temperature is reached at room temperature the sample is cursed into the fine powder and the fabricated nanoparticles are stored in a sample tube for further analysis (Fig. 1).
Characterization of the nanoparticles
The SEM image of the green synthesize Fe2O3 NPs conforms that the size of the bioinspired fabricated nanoparticles is in the range of 20–40 nm. It exhibits that the shape of the synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles has spherical morphology (Fig. 4). In the other reported work size of iron oxide nanoparticles also exist in this range [34].
The X-ray diffraction peaks of the bioinspired synthesized Fe2O3 NPs were observed at 2θ value of 24.6 (211), 32.1 (311), 33.4 (320), 35.6 (321), 41.5 (411), 45.2 (420), 49.8 (422), 54.3 (511), 63.7 (440) (Fig. 5). The result of analysis shows that synthesized nanoparticles of iron oxide are crystalline in nature. From the other research work it is confirmed that the synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles are shown following 2θ values [35,36].
