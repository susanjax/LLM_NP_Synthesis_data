 Biogenic synthesis of FALE@AuNPs
Synthesis of biogenic FALE@AuNPs was carried out by the mixing of aqueous solutions of FALE (20 mg/10 mL) and H[AuCl4].3H2O (1.269 mM, 10 mL). The sunlight was exposed to the resulting solution for about 5 min. The change of color in the reaction mixture from yellow to purple wine indicated the formation of FALE@AuNPs. The appearance of a characteristic LSPR peak at 535 nm confirmed the presence of AuNPs in the solution.
For the purification and separation of FALE@AuNPs, for about 20 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant containing unreacted and material was discarded while the bottom layer of solid FALE@AuNPs was washed twice with distilled water to remove impurities. For 6 h at 60 °C the sample obtained was kept in oven for drying. The dried powder was further used for characterization and application studies.
Characterization
 Formation of crystalline AuNPs was further confirmed by the investigation of PXRD spectra as shown in
Fig. 3B
. The PXRD spectra of FALE@AuNPs showed the intense characteristic diffraction peaks at 2ϴ values of 37.9°, 44.4°, 64.6° and 76.9° corresponding to miller indices 111, 200, 220 and 311 respectively. The presence of these peaks indicated the face centered cubic (fcc) structure of FALE@AuNPs as confirmed by the matching of peaks with JCPDS data file no. 04- 0784. The diffraction peaks with steric at 2ϴ values of 22.5°, 27.7° and 32.1° are due to components in plant extract. The average crystallite size of AuNPs was determined using Debye-Scherer relation as shown in Eq. (1).

D represents crystallite size, the wavelength is represented by λ of Cu K∝ X-rays (1.54 Å), θ is the diffraction angle, and β is the whole width at half maximum. The mean size of the crystallites was determined to be 25.4 nm. The crystallite size was determined to be less than the particle size due to the presence of several grains or crystals within the particle.

3.1.4. Compositional and morphological characterization
To assess the size and morphology of the biogenically synthesized FALE@AuNPs, SEM images of the FALE@AuNPs were taken at two different magnification as shown in
Fig. 4A
 and
B
. The SEM images show the formation of spherical shaped AuNPs ranging from size 20 to 60 nm. Size of the most of the FALE@AuNPs was greater than 50 nm. Some larger particles were also found in the form of aggregates. This average particle size of ≥50 nm of FALE@AuNPs was in agreement with the particle size estimated from UV–Vis spectrum The size of FALE@AuNPs calculated from UV–Vis spectra was 59 nm.
