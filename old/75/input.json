Preparation of ZnO nanosphere
Zinc oxide nanospheres were synthesized by using a modified sol-gel method (30). Briefly, three grams of yeast extract were nurtured in 100 mL of ultrapure water and left for one hour. Then, 25 mM of zinc acetate solution were added and mixed it with 50 ml of yeast extract solution under vigorous stirring at 1400 rpm for one hour, followed by thermal treatment at 500 °C for two hour. The resulting white precipitate has been dried and powdered and is ready to be characterized.
Characterization of ZnO nanospheres
As shown in Figure 1A, the FT-IR spectra of the ZnO nanospheres, there is a band at 3,429 cm-1 corresponding to the hydroxyl group of a water molecule on the surface of ZnO nanospheres that occurred because of the ZnO-nanosphere’s thermal treatment at 500°C. The band at 1,628 cm-1 is related to the OH bend in ZnO. Also, a strong band at 418 cm-1 was attributed to ZnO. As illustrated in Figure 1B, the XRD patterns of ZnO nanospheres showed that the peaks at 2 θ = 31.746°, 34.395°, 47.526°, 56.549°, 62.832°, 67.893° and 69.028° were assigned to (100), (002), (101), (110), (103), (200), (112), and (201) of ZnO nanospheres. All peaks are consistent with a polycrystalline Wurtzite structure (Zincite, JCPDS no. 89-1397). There are no characteristic peaks of any impurities, and this indicates a high ZnO nanospheres quality. Scherer’s equation estimated the average crystallite size (d) of ZnO nanospheres to be approximately 20 nm. DLS determined the average hydrodynamic size of the ZnO nanospheres in cell culture media, and it was about 20 nm, as revealed in Figure 1C.
