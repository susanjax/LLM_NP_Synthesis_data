 One-pot biogenic synthesis of AuNPs@saponins niosomes
The one-pot biogenic synthesis of AuNPs@saponins niosomes involved the addition of 10 mL of Sapindus mukorossi pericarps extract drop-wise into a 100 mL aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (1 mM). NaOH was then added until the pH of the solution reached 7.0. The resulting mixture was heated to 50 °C and stirred continuously for 2 h. A distinct colour change from light green to ruby red indicated the successful formation of AuNPs@saponins niosomes. The resulting solution underwent filtration using a 0.22 µm syringe filter and the AuNPs@saponins niosomes obtained were stored at 4 °C for characterizations and biological applications.
 Characterization of biogenically synthesized AuNPs@saponins niosomes
The present study examined the size and morphology distributions of AuNPs@saponins niosomes produced by an extract derived from Sapindus mukorossi pericarps. To conduct this analysis, both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques were employed. The SEM image of the AuNPs@saponins niosomes ( Fig. 5 (A)) displayed a smooth surface and spherical shape. Moreover, the size distribution of the AuNPs@saponins niosomes appeared uniform. To determine the chemical composition of the samples, Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS) was carried out, which revealed that the absorption band peak of approximately 2.5 keV observed in the spectrum was a characteristic feature of gold ( Fig. 5 (B)). Notably, the EDXS analysis was performed to collect information about the chemical composition of samples with atomic numbers (Z) > 3.
 Biogenic synthesis of AuNPs@saponins niosomes using Sapindus mukorossi pericarps extract
 AuNPs@saponins niosomes displayed a narrow particle size distribution and were measured to be between 3 and 6 nm in size using TEM ( Fig. 6 (A)). Smaller AuNPs@saponins niosomes were observed to have a uniform spherical shape. In general, the biosynthetic route typically leads to the production of nanoparticles with varying morphologies and sizes, which are dependent on the extract's chemical composition [60] , [61] . But, triterpenoid-based saponins matrix of Sapindus mukorossi surrounding the AuNPs was found to be uniform spherical shape and well-dispersed, indicating that it acts as a perfect capping agent to prevent aggregation. Particle size analysis (Dynamic Light Scattering, DLS) confirmed the average size of the AuNPs@saponins niosomes to be 3.5 nm ( Fig. 6 (B)).
