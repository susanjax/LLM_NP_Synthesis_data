synthesis of Chitosan-TiO2-metal ion nanocomposite
TiO2 nanoparticles tend to aggregate in the solvent due to active hydroxyl groups on the surface. The surface modification is the way to restrain the interaction of TiO2 nanoparticles. Here, TiO2 nanocomposites were prepared by following the previously reported protocol [28] (Fig. 1A). Briefly, TiO2 nanoparticles were pretreated by dispersing 2.5 g of nano TiO2 in 80 mL ethanol and then mixing the obtained white suspension with 9.0 μL diethanolamine. After 10 min of stirring, the mixture was transferred to an ultrasonic bath for 20 min at room temperature. The titania (white sediment) was collected by vacuum filtration and rinsed with ethanol.
Characterization
The obtained DLS values of the particle sizes and zeta potentials have been reported in Table S1. The zeta potential can express the effective electronic charge present over particles, surface-adsorbed ionic species, or surface acidity and basicity. TiO2 dispersion in water leads to the formation of negative charges on the surface and higher surface area that would render the higher coverage of water hydroxyl groups [33]. Here, metal ions (Ag+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+) can be deposited over the TiO2 surface through cationic adsorption. The synthesis of TiO2@metal composites (for example TiO2@Ag composite) can be summarized as follows: (i) TiO2 + Ag+ → TiO2@(Ag+) at pH 7.0 and (ii) TiO2 (Ag+) + BH−4 → TiO2@Ag at pH 10 [34].
SEM micrographs illustrate the morphology of ChiTiO@Ag, ChiTiO@Fe, ChiTiO@Cu, and ChiTiO@Zn composites and their chitosan-based films (Fig. 3, upper panel). The addition of TiO2-metal composites powders to the chitosan gel solution leads to the agglomeration of composite particles in the chitosan polymer [36]. This aggregation is caused by either a Brownian motion (random movement) mechanism leading to form collides or gravitation mechanisms that depend on nanocomposites' size and terminal velocity. Among the four different prepared composites, ChiTiO@Ag particles were found to be the most regular and spherical in the morphology, while the rest provided non-spherical particles with rough surfaces. It is probably due to the cross-linking reaction of chitosan with larger particles which can be broken easily under the stirring process of the preparation reaction.
