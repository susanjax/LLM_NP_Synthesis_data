Synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles
Zinc oxide nanoparticles were chemically synthesized by top down method under strong alkaline conditions maintained by sodium hydroxide (0.2 M) solution. In the first step, 1000 mL soluble starch solution (1 %) was prepared (45−45 °C) and 14.47 gm salt of Zinc nitrate was added to the above solution. The mixture was stirred continuously for 5 min to form a homogenous solution. To the above solution, 0.2 M sodium hydroxide was added dropwise with continuous stirring for 2 h to complete the reaction of zinc oxide nanoparticles synthesis. The above reaction solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min and pellets were obtained. The pellets were washed 3–4 times with deionized distilled water to remove any starch or chemical bounds to the zinc oxide nanoparticles. After washing with double distilled water, the pellet is washed again using ethanol. The pellet obtained after ethanol washing was dried at 80 °C in hot air oven for 2 h. The samples were stored at 4 °C for further experiments and analysis.
Characterization of zinc oxide nanoparticles
The XRD micrograph of the zinc oxide nanoparticles clearly indicates the presence of well-defined peaks located at Bragg angles (2θ = 20–80 degrees). The zinc oxide nanoparticles showed peak at value of 31.75° (100), 34.440 º (002), 36.252 º (101), 47.543 º (102), 56.555 º (110), 62.870 º (103), 67.917° (112) and 76.95° (202), indicating pure and crystalline nature of zinc oxide nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 2. The average size of zinc oxide nanoparticle crystal was found to be 24.84 nm using Debye–Scherrer equation and above crystalline value lie in the range of 20−26 nm.
Further, TEM micrograph of selected area diffraction pattern of zinc oxide nanoparticles confirmed the similar size and crystalline nature of nanoparticles. Synthesized nanoparticles were sticking to one another and agglomeration was observed in TEM micrographs (Fig. 3). Fig. 4 shows SEM micrograph of zinc oxide nanoparticles. Multiple shapes of nanoparticles were observed in SEM micrograph i.e spherical, hexagonal, oval etc. with an average diameter of 20−26 nm.
