Synthesis of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles
The biosynthesis of ZnO NPs utilizing O. majorana extract was achieved utilizing 0.01 M zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn (NO3)2·6H2O) solution. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn (NO3)2·6H2O) of reagent grade 98% was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, U.K. In essence, 5 mL of water extract from O. majorana leaves was combined with 95 mL of zinc nitrate solution (0.01 M), and the combination was stirred with a magnetic stirrer for an hour at 70 °C (150 rpm). The bioformulation of ZnO NPs was detected by formation of reduced precipitates. Finally, the bioreduced precipitates of ZnO NPs were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. After discarding the supernatants, the collected precipitates were washed three times with sterile distilled water for the elimination of the impurities [48].
Characterization of the Bioformulated ZnO NPs/
The dried ZnO NPs were characterized via the methods previously described in a prior study, including UV-Vis Spectroscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis, FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared) analysis, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and zeta potential analysis. Briefly, UV-Vis Spectroscopy was utilized to estimate the optical spectrum in wavelengths ranged from 200 to 800 nm and the elemental configuration of ZnO NPs was achieved using energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis.
he size and morphology of the bioformulated ZnO NPs were investigated using TEM analysis [68]. The biogenic ZnO NPs were depicted in Figure 5 in a multiplicity of shapes, including hexagons, spheres, and quasi-spheres. Additionally, the size distribution histogram demonstrated that the biogenic ZnO NPs had an estimated average nanosize of 12.467 nm and fluctuated in size from 5 to 50 nm in diameter (Figure 6). 
The crystallographic nature of the bioformulated ZnO NPs was investigated utilizing XRD analysis. Additionally, the XRD configuration demonstrated the detection of seven diffraction peaks at 2Ɵ degrees of 31.56, 34.32, 36.69, 46.63, 57.05, 64.79 and 77.73° as shown in Figure 9, conforming to the planes of (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), and (104), respectively [84]. These results were in agreement with those documented in the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS, card No. 89-7102). Collectively, these results established the hexagonal wurtzite configuration of the bioformulated ZnO NPs [85].
