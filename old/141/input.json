Green synthesis of α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles
Ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3.6H2O) was used as the precursor for the synthesis of the α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles. 50 mL of the papaya leaves extract was added dropwise with 50 mL of 0.1M FeCl3.6H2O solution in 1:1 ratio at room temperature. Following this, 1 M NaOH was added till the pH became 11. The resultant mixture was stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 30 min and the formation of intense black colored solution confirmed the synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles (Bibi et al., 2019). The nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 20 min and cleansed by subsequent washing with ethanol and water for 2–3 times. The NPs were finally dried in a hot air oven at 80 °C for 3 hr and stored in a seal tight container for further use.

Characterization
The XRD data as shown in Figure 3 indicates that the crystal planes of (012), (104), (110), (113), (024), (116) and (018) corresponding to the of 25.16°, 35.12°, 36.63°, 40.64°, 49.97°, 57.08°, and 59.42° indicates the formation of α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles. The intense and sharp peaks undoubtedly revealed that Fe2O3 nanoparticles formed by the reduction method using Carica papaya leaf extract were crystalline in nature. The results are almost similar to the results obtained for iron oxide nanoparticles by other researchers (Ahmmad et al., 2013; Suresh et al., 2016; Lassoued et al., 2018). The average crystallite size as determined using the Debye–Scherrer equation was found to be 4.58 nm.

The morphology of the synthesized nanoparticle is shown in Figure 4 (a-b). The figure indicates that the synthesized nanoparticles are not uniform in nature and get agglomerated in some cases. The size of NPs was determined by selecting 100 particles and their average diameter was found to be 21.59 nm (Figure 4c). The big agglomerated clusters were formed due to accumulation of tiny building blocks of various bioactive reducing agents of plant extract or this might be due to the lower capping ability of the plant extract and agglomeration tendency of the iron-based nanoparticles due to magnetic interactions.
