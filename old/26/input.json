Synthesis of silver nanoparticles
Silver nitrate (10^3 M AgNO3) (17 mg) was taken and dissolved in 100 ml of distilled water and used as silver nitrate stock solution. 1% (10,000 ppm) stock solutions (100 mg/10 mL) of methanolic extract of S. wightii and V. pachynema were prepared using 10 mL of double distilled water. From the stock solution, 7 different concentrations: 150 ppm, 200 ppm, 250 ppm, 500 ppm, 750 ppm, 1000 ppm and 2000 ppm were prepared separately with 10 ml double distilled water. To the above 0.75% of freshly prepared silver nitrate stock solution was added to each concentration and the pH was adjusted to 7 by adding 1% of NaOH solutionby drop by drop, the color change from yellow to yellowish brown indicated the formation of AgNPs.
Characterization of silver nanoparticles
Silver nanoparticles of S. wightii and V. pachynema were recorded by the color change of the reaction mixture from yellow to brown after 24 h. Different concentrations such as 150 ppm, 200 ppm, 250 ppm, 500 ppm, 750 ppm, 1000 ppm and 2000 ppm were subjected to UV–Visible spectrophotometer analysis between 380 and 420 nm. The surface plasmon resonance of AgNPs corresponds to 407 nm for S. wightii (2000 ppm) and 408 nm for V. pachynema (1000 ppm) (Fig. 1). According to Abboud et al., UV–Visible spectroscopy technique can be valuable tool in environmental, biotechnological and medical applications (Abboud et al., 2014). SEM image of AgNPs shows size ranging from 30 to 40 nm using V. pachynema (Fig. 2A) and 55–70 nm using S. wightii (Fig. 2B).
