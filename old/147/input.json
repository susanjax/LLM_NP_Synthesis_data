Green synthesis of CuO-NPs
The dried aerial parts were crushed using an electric mill. The extraction was prepared by the infusion method. E. alata powder was weighed at 45 g and put into Whatman filter papers, and then 120 ml of distilled water was added. The extraction was carried out at ambient temperature for a week, and the color of the aqueous solution changed from watery to brick red. For the synthesis of CuO nanoparticles, 30 ml of E. alata extract was taken and boiled at 90 °C 1 g of copper oxide pentahydrate (CuSO4.5H2O) was dissolved in 10 ml of a deionized water mixture and kept under agitation for 15 min at room temperature. When the temperature of the extract reached 90 °C, the copper oxide solution was added. The resulting mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 2 h at T = 90 °C. The paste was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min, three times, and then washed with doubly distilled water. The final product was dried in an oven at 40 °C for 24 h. Finally, the CuO nanoparticles were calcined at 400 °C for 4 h (Fig. 1).
Chemically synthesis of CuO-NPs
The hydrothermal method was used to synthesize CuO-NPs. First, 1 g of copper sulfate, CuSO4, 5H2O, was dissolved in 40 ml of deionized water (DIW) and stirred for a few minutes on the magnetic stirrer to obtain a homogeneous, blue-colored solution. After that, 1 g of KOH was dissolved in 90 ml of DIW and the potassium hydroxide was added drop by drop to the solution until the pH reached 10. When the potassium hydroxide is injected, the color of the solution starts to change. The mixture was stirred for 2 h at T = 90 °C. The blue solution changes to a dark-colored precipitate. In addition, the precipitate obtained was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min, three times, and then washed with doubly distilled water (DDW). The black product was dried at 80 °C for 18 h. Finally, the powder was calcined at 400 °C for 4 h ( Fig. 1 ).

Characterization
The crystal structure, crystallinity, and size of the crystallite of the nanoparticles were determined by X-ray diffraction. The XRD diagrams of chemical CuO-NP and biosynthetized CuO-NP are shown in Fig. 2 a. The diffraction peaks observed over 2θ of 32.53, 35.55, 38.75, 48.70, 53.54, 58.33, 61.55, 66.22, 68.15, 72.42, and 75.04° correspond to Miller indices (110) (−111) (111) (−202) (020) (202) (−113) (−311) (220) (311) (004) respectively. The observed peaks confirm the monoclinic structure of CuO-NPs, which corresponds to JCPDS map n° 89–5899. Similar results were obtained for CuO-NPs synthesized from an extract of P. Pyrifolia leaves and an extract of Urtica dioica leaves [ 53 , 54 ]. Additionally, no impurity peaks were observed in the diffractogram of the biosynthesized CuO-NPs, indicating the phase purity. However, for the chemical CuO-NPs, it is seen as a small peak was seen at 42.5° in the spectrum. This can be attributed to the presence of impurities, which is characteristic of Cu2O [ 55 , 56 ]. Moreover, the diffraction peaks of the biosynthesized CuO-NPs were sharp and well defined with high intensities, which indicates the good crystallinity. However, the corresponding chemical CuO-NPs peaks present lower intensities.
The two most intense diffraction peaks (−111) and (111) of the biosynthesized CuO-NP showed a positional shift to the left with respect to the chemical CuO-NP ( Fig. 2 b). This shift is due to the function of phytochemicals present in the extract of E. alata plant [ 17 ]. The average sample size was determined by Debye Scherer's Eq. (2) [ 57 ]: (2) where D is the crystallite size (Å), λ is the wavelength of the incident X-rays equal to 1.54 Å, k is a constant of 0.9, β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and θ is Bragg's angle. The average size of the chem CuO-NP and biosynthesized CuO-NP grains was found to be 9.23 and 15.21 nm, respectively. From Table 1 , it was observed that the size of biosynthesized CuO-NP increased relative to the chemical CuO-NP. This may be due to the effect of the extract affecting the parameters and volume of the lattice, resulting in the increase of the grain [ 18 ]. The microdeformation ε and dislocation density δ of chemical CuO-NPs and biosynthesized CuO-NPs were determined using the following Eq. (3,4) as [ 6 ]:
FE-SEM and EDX images of chemically synthesized CuO nanoparticles and green chemistry synthesized CuO nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5 . FE-SEM images ( Fig. 5 (a,b)) of the chemical CuO-NPs showed the appearance of a few mainly spherically-shaped crystals, which can be explained by slight agglomeration. The green CuO NPs revealed that the powders are composed of octahedral crystal clusters and some spherical nanoparticles. This agglomeration is due to the oxidation of metal nanoparticles and the overlapping of small crystals ( Fig. 5 (d,e)). This can be caused by the coating of various surface active groups from the prepared extracts [ 20 , 63 ]. On the other hand, the elements present in the prepared CuO NPs were confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and the observed peaks are shown in Fig. 5 (c,f). It is observed that the synthesized CuO NPs are principally constituted by Cu, O and C without any trace of other elements, which confirms the purity of the copper oxide without other impurities. No other components were present, even from the extract. In both samples, the EDX spectra indicated a high signal peak at 1 keV corresponding to copper atoms [ 19 , 68 ].
