Preparation of iron oxide nanoparticles
Magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized using thermal decomposition method at low temperatures ranging between 100 and 120 °C. 0.2 g of pectin was dissolved in 200 ml of water with continuous stirring. Then added 20 mg/2 ml ethanol solution of Fe (acac)3 gradually to the solution of pectin and no change was noticed in the reaction mixture. The magnetic stirring was continued for 4 h. Then 20 mg of NaBH4 was added which resulted in a vigorous reaction with huge amount of effervescence due to the H2 gas evolution and further the reaction mixture turned black in color which confirmed the formation of iron oxide nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were observed to be stuck on the magnet bar which confirmed their paramagneticity. Within two hours of stirring the color changed gradually from black to reddish brown which pointed towards the formation of γ-Fe2O3 by a phase transformation from Fe3O4 [35]. To check the dispersion of nanoparticles a sedimentation test was conducted. A homogeneous solution was ultra-sonicated and left for a few hours and found that no deposition of the particles took place in the magnetic bar.
Characterization of iron oxide nanoparticles
Fig. 1 displayed the powder X- ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the dried iron oxide nano powders. This clearly indicates the diffraction peaks in accordance with [JCPDS: 00-39-1346] (γ-Fe2O3) [37]. The presence of low intensity peaks at 18.4° and 26.0° along with the characteristic peaks of γ-Fe2O3 at 30.0°, 43.1° assure the formation of maghemite nanoparticles and rules out the formation of magnetite. 
The particle sizes were calculated from Deby-scherrer [52] formula and the mean size was found to be 12.4 nm. The morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles which were dispersed in water was studied by SEM and TEM as shown in Fig. 2. In this, we came across a hazy electron diffraction pattern [30] due to the amorphous nature of apple pectin [36] which is also supported by XRD pattern of the nanoparticles containing intense peaks for pectin at 21.6° and 12.3°. The images show less dispersed nanoparticles and the size distributions obtained from the SEM are larger as compared with TEM images, also supported by Deby-scherrer measurements. This may be due to the compact arrangement of nanoparticles or there may be some measurement errors [41], [51]. The shapes of the nanoparticles were judged to be nearly spherical on the basis of TEM images. The size of the nanoparticles was calculated by image-J NIH software and it was found that the particles size lies between the 2–6 nm.
