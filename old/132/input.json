Synthesis of ZnO-NPs
50 mL of the extract were heated to 60–70 °C and then 5 g of AR. Zinc nitrate was added to it when the temperature reaches 60 °C. This mixture is then boiled until it reduced to an off white paste. This white paste is collected in a crucible and is heated in a muffle furnace at 400 °C for 2 h in a crucible to get white powder of ZnO. This material was made into a fine powder using mortar and pestle [34].
 Physical characterization of samples
3.1.1. XRD analysis
XRD gives regularity in an atomic arrangement. Fig. 1a shows X-ray diffraction patterns of ZnO-NPs prepared using different plant extracts. Fig. 1b shows the conformity simulate scan from pattern ZnO-NPs. XRD peaks consistent with the JCPDS card number 89–0510, hexagonal phase, and primitive geometry of ZnO nanoparticles. The broadening in the X-ray diffraction pattern indicates the nano-sized material. Scherrer formula was used to calculate the average size of the ZnO-NPs [[25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]].
where β is the full width at half maximum, D is the average crystallite size, θ is the diffraction angle, and λ is the wavelength of the incident radiation. The average crystallite sizes for ZnO-NPs by choosing (101), the highest peak are at an angle of 36.20° for plants BE1, VA1, PA1, and BR1, 14, 19, 27, and 30 nm, respectively.
The sharp peaks indicate the purity and crystallinity of ZnO-NPs. The detected peaks were found at the lattice planes of (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112) and (202) in the 2θ = 31.7°, 34.4°, 36.2°, 47.4°, 56.5°, 62.8°, 67.9°, 76.9° respectively correspond with those of hexagonal phase zincite. Based on the results of XRD and peak intensities, it can be concluded that the plant extract has a significant influence on the crystalline structure of the NPs, while the process of formation of ZnO phases for different plants in the XRD spectrum is the same. Their only difference was found to be in the intensity of the peaks, which was due to the formation of crystals in the ZnO phases for different plants, which may be due to the chemical structure of the plant extract. As shown in Fig. 1, PA1, BE1, BR1, and VA1 are more intense, respectively. That means that PA1 plant has more significant effect on the crystalline structure and the increased peak intensities for the production of zinc oxide nanoparticles than other plants.
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is a method for high-resolution surface imaging used to get information about nanostructures and other materials in microscopic level which uses electron beam for surface imaging. Higher magnification and larger field depth makes SEM images useful in getting surface topological information of various nano objects depending on the electron density of the surface. SEM images of four different ZnO-NPs are given in Fig. 3.
In the case of BE1, SEM images indicate the particles are almost spherical. The particles were agglomerated to form a sponge-like bunch of particles. This agglomeration could be induced by densification resulting in narrow space between particles. The size and shape of the nanoparticles depend upon the nature of the reducing agent present in Beta vulgaris. In the case of VA1, the SEM image of the green synthesized nanoparticles was carried out at different magnifications such as 5000× and 20000×. The synthesized nanoparticles showed some agglomeration due to the polarity and electrostatic attraction of ZnO-NPs. Moreover, for PA1, it is observed that particles are almost spherical. Agglomeration of particles is also obvious in the images which results in formation of the sponge-like bunches which could be possibly induced by densification of the nanoparticles resulting in narrow space leading to the agglomeration between particles. SEM images for BR1 sample showed individual and agglomerated particles. The agglomerated particles indicate the larger size and low surface to volume ratio. The size and shape of the nanoparticles depend on the nature of the reducing agent present in Brassica oleracea var. italica.
