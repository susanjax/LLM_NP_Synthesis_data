Green synthesis of SnNiCoO2 NPs
The SnNiCoO2 NPs were fabricated by the green route approach. First, the 0.002 M of nickel nitrate solution and Cobalt nitrate solution of 0.002 M was added into an aqueous tin chloride solution of 0.094 M. Then, 100 mL of Psidium guajava leaf extract was mixed to the solution, and magnetically agitated for 20 min to produce a homogenous green solution. The resulting solution was then microwaved at 800 W for 10 min in autoclave bottles with polypropylene caps and then cooled to 37 °C and cleansed many times using deionized water and ethanol. The obtained residue was dehydrated at 120 °C, and a light white powder was obtained. Finally, SnNiCoO2 NPs were calcinated at 800 °C for 5 h and then used for further analysis.
Characterization of green SnNiCoO2 NPs
The XRD pattern of green SnNiCoO2 NPs is depicted in Fig. 1a. The SnNiCoO2 NPs diffraction peaks at 2θ = 26.05, 33.31, 37.42, 38.39, 51.21, 54.21, 57.34, 61.36, 64.27, 65.37, 70.71 and 78.20 respectively. Which corresponding hkl planes are (1 1 0), (1 0 1), (2 0 0), (1 1 1), (2 1 1), (2 2 0), (0 0 2), (3 1 0), (1 1 2), (3 0 1), (2 0 2), and (3 2 1) for SnNiCoO2 NPs. The prepared SnNiCoO2 NPs exhibit a rutile structure. It is perfectly matched with standard diffraction peaks of SnO2 NPs (JCPDS 77–0450). The Scherrer equation (D = Kλ/(βcosθ)) was used to compute the average size, where λ-is the X-ray wavelength, D is the grain size, K is the constant 0.89, β-is the full-wave half-maximum width of the diffraction peak and θ is the diffraction angle (Naje et al., 2013). SnNiCoO2 NPs exhibited an average crystalline size of 65 nm.
The surface morphology and elemental mapping were investigated by EDAX spectrum, and FESEM are revealed in (Fig. 2a, 2b, and 3). The FE-SEM images of SnNiCoO2 NPs were found to be spherical with uniformly sized particles and an average size of 65 nm. From the EDAX spectra, the atomic percentage of Sn, Ni, Co, and O were observed at 19.53 %, 0.60 %, 0.55 %, and 79.32 %, respectively. The element mapping observed for SnNiCoO2 NPs and uniform distribution of elements was (Sn, Ni, Co, and O) throughout the material.(See Fig. 3).
