Synthesis of TiO2 Nanoparticles (TDN)
TDN was prepared by the sol-gel method. The procedures were carried out according to the previously described method with slight modifications.10 Briefly, 5 mL of titanium tetrachloride were added to 50 mL of absolute Ethanol; the mixture was stirred for 30 min using a magnetic stirrer till a yellow sol phase was formed. While stirring, 200 mL of distilled water were added until the solution became colorless and clear. The solution was further stirred for 45 min while the temperature was kept at 25–30°C. The formed TDN was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min, washed by distilled water several times, and then dried at 50°C for 30 h.
Characterizations of TDN
In this study, TDN was prepared using the sol-gel method. The average particle size determined by DLS was 64.77 ± 0.14 nm. This small size of nanoparticles provides a large surface area that enhances the interactions with the microbes and increases the range of antimicrobial activities.15 The ﻿poly ﻿dispersive ﻿index (PDI) was 0.274 ± 0.004, which is lower than 0.3, indicating the homogenous population of the particle size16 as shown in Figure 1. According to literature, this value suggests the stability of the prepared TDN with storage as zeta potential value was 23.8 mV. As TDN suspension has large positive or negative zeta potential, particles in suspension will tend to repel from each other which prevents aggregation and agglomeration of the particles.17 The morphology was investigated by a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (Figure 2). Images showed that the prepared nanoparticles were nearly spherical in shape of irregular edges with little aggregations at different magnifications (Figure 2A, ​,C,C, and ​andD).D). Particle size histogram showed that the maximum distribution of particle sizes was in the range of 60–80 nm (Figure 2B), and that agrees with DLS results. Many nanoparticle shapes with nonuniform size and superficial agglomeration were reported for TiO2, which appeared to be a normal reaction during the sol-gel method synthesis.18,19
