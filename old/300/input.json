Ag/AgCl-NPs synthesis
The formation of E. floribundus leaf extract-mediated Ag/AgCl-NPs was primarily indicated by the change of yellowish-colored leaf extract into dark brown-colored solution after reaction with AgNO3 in suitable conditions under sunlight. This color change was probably due to the surface plasmon resonance of Ag/AgCl-NPs and bioreduction of Ag+ of AgNO3 to Ag0 by the reducing or capping agents like different bioactive phytochemicals existing in the E. floribundus leaf extract [12] , [27] .

The clear supernatant was taken into test tubes (2 ml/tube) under various pH conditions (pH 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 12). Subsequently, 1 M silver nitrate was poured into each test tube to achieve ultimate concentrations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 mM. These combinations were then exposed to sunlight for different periods to facilitate the synthesis of nanoparticles. The above procedures were carried out according to Ghose et al.

        After observing the UV–visible spectra at different AgNO3 concentrations for 105 min reaction time shown in
Fig. 1
(a) and 6 mM AgNO3 concentration for different reaction time shown in
Fig. 1
(b), we selected the conditions of 6 mM AgNO3 and 105 min reaction time to adjust pH. The sharpest absorbance peak was observed between 427 and 432 nm for the solution containing 6 mM of AgNO3 at pH 9 and 105 min of reaction time shown in
Fig. 1
(c), which was another indication of NPs generation. This UV–visible spectral result is supported by the study of Alharbi and Alsubhi

SEM analysis
Synthesized Ag/AgCl-NPs were found to be nearly spherical with uneven surfaces as indicated by SEM results shown in
Fig. 3
(a). Most of the plant-mediated Ag/AgCl-NPs are spherical

TEM analysis
TEM image shown in
Fig. 3
(b) indicated Ag/AgCl-NPs as highly monodispersed. The average particle size was measured as approximately 19.92 nm by size analysis shown in
Fig. 3
(c). Kabir et al.
[38]
 also synthesized highly monodispersed Ag/AgCl-NPs from Asparagus racemosus.

XRD pattern analysis
The crystalline nature of the dry powder form of synthesized Ag/AgCl-NPs was analyzed by XRD shown in
Fig. 4
(a). XRD pattern showed three distinct diffraction peaks at 38.22°, 44.29°, and 64.49° which pertained to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) of AgNPs, respectively (JCPDS file no. 00-150-9146) that indicated the formation of face-centered cubic (FCC) structure of AgNPs. Likewise, the Bragg reflections at 24.47°, 27.87°, 32.31°, 46.31°, 54.92°, 57.57°, 67.53°, 74.22° and 77.39° could be indexed to the (1 2 1), (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 2 2), (4 0 0), (3 3 1) and (4 2 0) planes, respectively (JCPDS file no. 00-901-1666) also indicated face-centered cubic structure of AgCl-NPs. According to the assumption of Devi et al.
[41]
, at the very beginning, Ag+ of AgNO3 reacted with Cl– of phytochemical compounds of the E. floribundus leaf extract to form AgCl-NPs. Stabilizing groups of phytochemicals further stabilized the synthesized AgCl-NPs. On the other side, during AgNPs formation, these phytochemicals also reduced Ag+ to Ag. At first, Ag+ formed a transitional complex with –OH groups of alcoholic and flavonoid compounds of the E. floribundus leaf extract. This transitional complex joined in an oxidation reaction to reduce Ag+ into AgNPs.
