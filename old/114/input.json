Synthesis of copolymer-stabilized silver nanoparticles
Synthesis of p(NIPAM-co-MQ)
p(NIPAM-co-MQ) copolymer was prepared through a classical free radical polymerization from the two monomers of NIPAM and MQ according to the previous route [38]. First, NIPAM (5.0 g, 0.045 mol), MQ (0.25 g, 0.88 mol) and AIBN (0.15 g, 0.93 mmol) were added into a three-neck bottle with 100 mL THF. The oxygen of reaction system was excluded by the influx of nitrogen gas for 30 min. Then the polymerization system was heated to 70 °C under nitrogen protection for 10 h. The final copolymer product was precipitated with petroleum, and purified several times, then dried under vacuum at room temperature for 12 h.
Preparation of copolymer stabilized AgNPs (AgNPs@P)
In order to prepare different AgNPs@P samples, the molar ratios of AgNO3 and MQ monomer unit in copolymer P(NIPAM-co-MQ) was controlled at 1:0.1, 1:0.5 and 1:1, separately, and the corresponding products are defined as AgNPs@P1, AgNPs@P2 and AgNPs@P3, respectively. Typical synthetic process of AgNPs@P1 is as following: 1.625 mg of copolymer was dissolved in 4.85 mL deionized water, and then 100 μL AgNO3 (0.02 M) solution was added. After strong stirring for 2 h in the dark, 50 μL NaBH4 (0.5 M) was quickly added to reduce the silver ions with vigorous agitation for additional 8 h. The obtained samples were dialyzed one day, and then were stored in 4 °C refrigerator for subsequent use.
characterization of AgNPs@P
The XPS test was carried out to examine the elemental composition of AgNPs@P3. As shown in Fig. 1B, the XPS full spectrum displays four typical peaks of C, N, and O and Ag3d elements at 285, 399, 531 and 368 eV. The C1s spectrum (Fig. 1C) of AgNPs@P3 can be fitted into four peaks components with the binding energies at 284.6 (Csingle bondC), 285.8 (Csingle bondN), 287.3 (Cdouble bondO/Csingle bondO), and 288.5 eV (Osingle bondCdouble bondO), respectively [50]. Fig. 1D also disclosed the existence of N1s at 398.9 (Ndouble bondC) and 399.6 eV (NHsingle bondC), respectively. Three peaks at 530.8 (Cdouble bondO), 531.7 (C-O-C) and 532.9 eV (Csingle bondO) are also observed in the O1s spectrum (Fig. 1E) [51]. As given in Fig. 1F, the signal peaks at 367.1 and 373.0 eV are corresponding to Ag3d5/2 and Ag3d3/2, respectively. The difference between the two peaks is about 6 eV, indicating that the silver is present as zero-valent silver nanoparticles [52]. The crystal structures of copolymer-stabilized AgNPs (AgNPs@P1, AgNPs@P2 and AgNPs@P3) were characterized by powder XRD. As deposited in Fig. S2, the XRD patterns of different AgNPs@P samples exhibit typical diffraction peaks at 2θ = 38.2, 44.5, 63.7, and 77.4°, which are ascribed to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) (222) crystalline planes of cubic Ag. It is also observed that the intensities of these diffraction peaks of AgNPs@P decrease with the increasing feeding ratio of copolymer to silver precursor, and the characteristic peak of amorphous copolymers also appears at about 2θ = 20°. This result should be owing to smaller silver particle size and higher amorphous polymer coating content on AgNPs@P.
The morphology of different AgNPs@P samples was researched by TEM as shown in Fig. 3. It can be observed that the average size of the three samples of AgNPs@P1, AgNPs@P2 and AgNPs@P3 is about 3.91 nm, 2.29 nm, and 1.59 nm, respectively. This indicated that the particle size of the copolymer stabilized AgNPs gradually reduced with increasing ratio of copolymer to Ag precursor, accompanied by decreasing particle size distribution of AgNPs. In addition, the citric acid stabilized AgNPs as a control sample was also synthesized according to the previous reported method [55]. Fig. S4 shows the AgNPs have a mean size of about 10 nm with a larger particle size distribution than that of AgNPs@P. This result also proves that the MQ-containing copolymer can effectively control the size and dispersion of silver nanoparticles owing to its robust coordination ability.
