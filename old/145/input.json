Preparation of Ag@CFRs
Silver nanoparticle@catechol formaldehyde resin microspheres (Ag@CFRs) were prepared based on our previous work [ 22 , 29 ]. Briefly, 1 mmol of silver nitrate was dissolved in 200 mL of deionized water and stirred thoroughly. A mixture of 5 mmol of HMT and 10 mmol of catechol was added slowly to this solution. Then, the resulting mixture was transferred to a hydrothermal reactor and heated at 160 °C for 6 h. Once cooled to room temperature, the mixture underwent centrifugal washing with anhydrous ethanol and deionized water. The precipitate obtained was desiccated in an oven at 50 °C for future use. The as-prepared Ag@catechol-derived particles were donated as Ag@CFRs.
Preparation of Ag@CFRs-encapsulated hydrogels
The OHA was synthesized following a previously study [ 25 ], which was detailed in the Supporting information (SI). To prepare Ag@CFRs-loaded hydrogels, 5.0 wt% OHA solution, and 1.0 wt% Ag@CFR solution are thoroughly mixed by magnetic stirring, followed by the uniform mixing of the resultant mixture with the 10.0 wt% CMCS solution. The mixture is then allowed to stand for overnight to obtain the desired hydrogel. The formed Ag@CFRs-loaded OHA/CMCS hydrogels were named as ACHC, and the pure OHA/CMCS hydrogel without particle loading was donated as HC.

Characterization
The Ag@CFRs were synthesized by a polycondensation reaction based on formaldehyde and catechol under alkaline conditions. The particle morphology and enlarged image of the as-prepared Ag@CFRs was observed by FE-SEM and showed in Fig. 1 a. It was found that the Ag@CFRs exhibited a uniform spherical shape with an average particle size of about 880.0 ± 210.0 nm (Fig. S1a). Upon further magnification, it was observed that numerous Ag NPs with a diameter of 7.8 ± 0.5 nm emerged on the surface of the Ag@CFR spheres (Fig. S1b and c). As observed in Fig. 1 d, the SEM equipped with EDX identified the presence of characteristic elements, including Ag, O, and C, on the surface of the Ag@CFRs.
Simultaneously, the spherical morphology of the Ag@CFRs was further examined by TEM. As shown in Fig. 1 b, Ag NPs with an average diameter of about 20.0 ± 5.0 nm were unusually concentrated inside the CFR, indicating the penetration and in situ-reduction of the Ag ions inside the CFR matrix [ 16 ]. Simultaneously, abundantly homogeneous Ag NPs were deposited on the surface of CFR spheres with an average diameter of about 8.0 nm in TEM. And randomly selected nanoparticles on the Ag@CFRs surface exhibited evident lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of ca. 0.25 nm ( Fig. 1 c), corresponding to the lattice plane (111) of face-centered cubic Ag [ 32 ]. Moreover, XRD analysis of Ag@CFR powders exhibited prominent peaks at 38.1° (Ag (111)), 44.2° (Ag (200)), 64.3° (Ag (220)), and 77.4° (Ag (311)) ( Fig. 1 e). Based on the above observations, it is confirmed that face-centered cubic structured Ag NPs exist both on the surface and interior of the microsphere [ 16 , 32 ]. Subsequently, DLS was employed to evaluate the zeta potential and the average diameter of the Ag@CFRs in aqueous solution, respectively. As displayed in Fig. 1 f, the average diameter of the Ag@CFRs in aqueous solution was about 890 ± 125 nm, which was comparable with the statistical results from SEM images. And the zeta potential value of Ag@CFRs was about −31.5 mV, which indicated the stability of the as-prepared Ag@CFRs in aqueous solution. The picture in Fig. S2 showed the dispersion of Ag@CFRs in the aqueous medium, which maintained a stable color for 10 h. This observation further revealed that Ag@CFRs have appropriate stability in an aqueous dispersion.
Hydrogel dressings can maintain a moist environment around the wound, facilitate the absorption of tissue exudate, as well as promote wound healing, which may serve as a platform for functional nanoparticles, ensuring their stability and uniform dispersion [ 33 ]. Fig. 2 a illustrated the schematic diagram depicting the preparation process of the ACHC hydrogel, which was developed by the Schiff base reaction between aldehyde groups in OHA and amino groups in CMCS. In FTIR spectra of raw material and hydrogels (Fig. S3), the observation of various characteristic peaks of Ag@CFRs indicates successful synthesis of the Ag@CFR particles and integration of particles into the HC matrix. The morphology of the lyophilized HC and ACHC hydrogels was observed by SEM. As shown in Fig. 2 b, all hydrogels showed a typical interconnected and porous microstructure. And the higher magnification in Fig. 2 b showed that the Ag@CFRs in the form of spherical particles were randomly distributed on the wall of the pores of the ACHC hydrogel.
