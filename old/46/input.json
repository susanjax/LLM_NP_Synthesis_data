Biosynthesis of CS-AuNPs
Approximately 0.0225 g of low moleucular weight (LMW) chitosan (CS) was dissolved in 6 mL of 2% v/v acetic acid under magnetic stirring at 500 rpm for 30 min. Subsequently, 100 μL of 0.1 M HAuCl4 solution was added to chitosan and different concentrations of CLRE solution (8 mL of 0.0125, 0.025, or 0.05 g/mL). The mixtures were continuously stirred under magnetic stirring and heating at 65 °C and pH 4.5 for 2.5 h until a stable purplish-wine color was observed. The resultant mixtures were cooled to room temperature and stored in the refrigerator at 5 °C for further studies. These steps were repeated for different concentrations of HLRE (0.0125, 0.025, and 0.05 g/mL).
Characterization of CS-AuNPs
In this study, different concentrations (0.0125, 0.025, and 0.05 g/mL) of LRE influenced the formation of AuNPs. The UV–vis spectrum of the AuNPs showed an increase in peak intensity with increasing LRE concentration, indicating an increased number of AuNPs.
The CS-AuNPs were mostly spherical in shape except for some that showed irregular, triangular, pentagonal, and rod shape nanoparticles particularly, for the low concentration of LRE (0.0125 g/mL) (Fig. 5). Low concentrations of plant extract were reported to interact with gold ions to produce triangular and other irregular shapes. However, the addition of higher concentrations of plant extract led to the production of spherical shaped AuNPs (Song et al., 2009).
Extracellular biosynthesis of AuNPs using plant extracts can be performed in a controlled manner, by tuning their size, shape, and dispersity (Kumar and Yadav, 2009). The particle size of AuNPs is influenced by the quantity of plant extract used, concentration of metal ions, reaction temperature, time, and pH (Iravani, 2011, Dubey et al., 2010a, Dubey et al., 2010b, Philip, 2009). In this study, the size of the AuNPs was investigated by varying the concentration of LRE and extraction method (CWE or HWE) used.
The CS-AuNPs increased in size with increasing LRE concentration, regardless of the type of extraction (CWE or HWE, Table 1). These results differed from those reported previously (Iravani, 2011, Song et al., 2009) that showed the opposite relationship. The CS-AuNPs synthesized using the CLRE were smaller in size (82.4 ± 28.0, 62.9 ± 5.8, and 49.5 ± 6.7 nm for 0.05, 0.025, and 0.0125 g/mL, respectively) than those synthesized using the HLRE (125.3 ± 41.5, 104.4 ± 11.2, and 80.3 ± 23.4 nm for 0.05, 0.025, and 0.0125 g/mL, respectively). However, the size of the CS-AuNPs was not significantly affected by LRE concentrations (ANOVA, post-hoc analysis, p > 0.05 (Table Supplementary 2(a) and (b))). The PDI values of the CS-AuNPs were slightly above 0.5, except for that of the CS-AuNPs prepared using the CLRE at 0.0125 g/mL which had a lower value (Table 1) and was within the acceptable range
