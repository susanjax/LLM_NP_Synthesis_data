Synthesis of CF, CF-Zn and CF-Ni
Cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)2 6H2O), zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)3 9H2O), nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)3 9H2O), citric acid (C6H8O7. H2O), and iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3 9H2O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cobalt nitrate, citric acid, and iron nitrate were used as precursors for the preparation of cobalt ferrite NPs. Firstly, 0.2 M of cobalt nitrate and 0.2 M of iron nitrate were dissolved in 40 mL distilled water. The CF precursors were magnetically stirrer for 4 h. Then, 0.4 M of citric acid was added to the resultant solution. Neutral pH conditioned were maintained throughout the reaction. The resulting solution was subsequently heated up to 100 °C with constant stirring for 2 h, resulting in a brown gel. The resultant brown powder was sintered at 800 °C for 3 h to obtain brittle flakes. In a similar procedure, 3% of zinc ions and 3% of nickel ions substituted CF NPs were synthesized. The synthesized cobalt ferrite, zinc substituted cobalt ferrite, and nickel substituted cobalt ferrite NPs are referred to as CF, CF-Ni and CF-Zn, respectively. The prepared materials were all characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) [31].
Structural property of CF, CF-Zn and CF-Ni nanoparticles
The structure and the phase of the prepared CF, CF-Zn and CF-Ni nanoparticles were examined using X-ray diffraction analysis. The XRD analysis of the samples is shown in Fig. 1 reveals the formation of cobalt ferrite in all the samples. The peaks at 30.12°, 35.57°, 37.3°, 43.20°, 53.50°, 57.23°, and 62.88° corresponds to the (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511) and (440) planes of cobalt ferrite. The CF-Ni and CF-Zn show similar XRD patterns after substituting the Zn and Ni, and match with the cubic spinel structure of cobalt ferrite (JCPDS -#22–1086) with the Fd3m space group. Abdel Maksoud et al. [49] also reported the formation of cubic spinel structure after the addition of transition metal ions. The substitution of zinc and nickel ions did not alter the phase of the cobalt ferrite. The intensity of the planes decreased with the substitution of zinc and nickel ions. The peak broadening was obtained, which confirmed the successful addition of zinc and nickel ions in the CF. The crystallite size of the CF, CF-Ni and CF-Zn nanoparticles was estimated using Debye Scherrer equation [50].

where, K-0.9, λ-X-ray wavelength, θ-angle of Bragg diffraction, and β-full width at the half-maximum. The calculated strain, dislocation density, strain crystallite size and cell volume of the samples are shown in Table 1. The crystallite size of CF-Zn and CF-Ni decreased down to 7.2 and 5.1 nm, respectively which is significantly lower than for CF (8.3 nm). This suggest the distortion of the CF crystal lattice due to the substitution of the zinc and nickel ions that replaced Co, resulted in a reduced crystallite size for CF-Ni and CF-Zn. This reduction in crystallite size of CF-Zn and CF-Ni might contribute to improve their biological properties.
Morphology features of CF, CF-Zn and CF-Ni nanoparticles
The morphology of the CF, CF-Zn and CF-Ni nanoparticles were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of the CF, CF-Zn and CF-Ni nanoparticles. These reveal the formation of interconnected spherical-shaped particles with some degree of agglomeration. The morphology of the CF slightly changed after the addition of Zn and Ni ions onto the CF surface. The ionic radius of the Zn and Ni ions influences the morphology of the nanoparticles by varying crystal growth during synthesis. The substitution of Zn and Ni alters the nucleation of the material that slightly changes the morphology of the CF-Ni and CF-Zn. The variation in the morphology and size of the NPs confirmed the successful substitution of Zn and Ni ions. Also, the SEM images of the CF-Zn NPs shows that these possess a hexagonal-shape.
