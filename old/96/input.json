Preparation and characterization of SiNPs with different sizes
Four kinds of SiNPs were fabricated using modified Stöber methods as previously described [44]. Briefly, 350 mL of 8.2 mM aqueous L-arginine (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared in in a 500-mL round-bottom flask, and it was warmed to 50 °C. The mixture of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, 98%, ACROS) and cyclohexane (99%, Samchun Chemicals) was added (TEOS:cyclohexane = 3:2) to the solution and vigorously stirred for 24 h, resulting in the 20-nm SiNPs. The SiNPs sized 30 nm were fabricated via almost same method with 20-nm SiNPs. 6 mL of the mixture of TEOS and cyclohexane (1:0.8) was added to 41.4 mL of 2.2 mM aqueous L-arginine and the temperature was kept overnight at 70 °C. To obtain 40 and 50 nm sized SiNPs, 5 mL of TEOS was added to the 30-nm SiNPs reaction solution at 24-h intervals for serial regrowth. These resultant SiNPs suspensions were collected by using a separatory funnel to isolate from organic layer. TEM specimens were prepared by placing the droplets of SiNPs suspension onto 200-mesh copper grids. The grids are allowed to completely dry before the measurement.
Characteristics of SiNPs
We prepared SiNPs of various sizes using the modified method reported by Hartlen, utilizing a small variation of the solvent mixture ratio [23]. As shown in Fig. 1a and Additional file 1: Fig. S1, the morphology of ‘seed’ SiNPs was determined via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Spherical SiNPs had a Feret diameter and monodispersity of 21.8 ± 0.6 nm, which was further increased to 31.4 ± 2.4, 42.9 ± 2.8, and 56.7 ± 1.5 via the regrowth procedure. Uncertainty was calculated in accordance with the Guide to Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM), revealing no overlap among SiNPs in terms of independent size distribution. Despite their monodispersity, some nanoparticles can aggregate in an aqueous environment.
