Synthesis of GA-AgNPs
The synthesis of GA-AgNPs was carried out via the following method. 5 mL GA solution (1 mM) was added into boiling 10 mL silver nitrate (1 mM) solution. Subsequently, the pH of the solution was adjusted by adding potassium carbonate. The reaction was left for 20 min resulting in color change of solution from colorless to yellow, indicating the formation of silver nanoparticles. Finally, the synthesized GA-AgNPs were washed with deionized water by repeated centrifugation and washing and characterized via different techniques as described below.
Characterization of GA-AgNPs
The morphology and size of the synthesized GA-AgNPs was interpreted with the help of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM micrograph demonstrated that the size of the synthesized GA-AgNPs was around 18 Â± 2 nm ( Fig. 2 a). The morphology of the synthesized GA-AgNPs was found to be spherical in nature. Also, a corona layer was observed around each nanoparticle ( Fig. 2 a). In this context, some reports suggest that this corona layer can affect the internalization mechanism into the cells [ [38] , [39] , [40] ]. However, shape, charge, size of the nanoparticles can also influence the corona composition and cellular response [ 41 ]. Cell receptors can diagnose and join with such a corona layer, and this layer strongly affects the forthcoming interactions with cells and is responsible for the controlled release of the nanoparticles into the cells [ 42 ]. Also, the size as observed by the TEM studies was smaller than that measured by dynamic light scattering analysis. The DLS size distribution image of synthesized GA-AgNPs is shown in Fig. 2 b. It is observed that the size distribution GA-AgNPs ranges from 30 to 40 nm. The calculated average particle size distribution of GA-AgNPs was approximately 35 nm.
