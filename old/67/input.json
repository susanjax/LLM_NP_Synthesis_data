Preparation of oleic acid coated iron oxide (Fe3O4-OA) magnetic nanoparticles Iron oxide, i.e., magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles were synthesized by co-precipitation method using ferric (0.1 mole) and ferrous chloride (0.05 mole) salts at 2 : 1 molar ratio of Fe3+ : Fe2+. Ferric and ferrous chloride were dissolved in 100 mL of water and heated to 80 °C followed by the addition of 15 mL of ammonium hydroxide, and the reaction was kept under mechanical stirring for 1 hour at ambient condition. Oleic acid (10 mL) was added to the reaction system to introduce a coating of oleic acid on magnetite nanoparticles denoted as Fe3O4-OA, and the reaction mixture was mechanically stirred for another 2 hours. Finally, the nanoparticles were purified by five times washing with water and ethanol, and the particles were dried and stored for further use.
The synthesis, surface modification and vancomycin conjugation of IONPs steps are schematically illustrated in Scheme 1. Hydrophobic Fe3O4-OA were synthesized by the coating of oleic acid on Fe3O4 and dispersible in organic solvent, e.g., chloroform, as shown in the digital photograph (upper rightmost) of Scheme 1. Though, the average hydrodynamic diameter of Fe3O4-OA nanoparticles was found to be 39.3 nm from DLS, but TEM image indicated the particle size in the range of 10–20 nm (Fig. 1b). Two-fold increase in particles size for DLS is due to hydrodynamic measurement and little aggregations of nanoparticles. This may be due in part to the presence of the oleic acid layer surrounding the particles.
The XRD pattern of Fe3O4-OA nanoparticles shown in Fig. 1c demonstrates the characteristic diffraction signal at two theta (2θ) value of 18° corresponding to amorphous segments of oleic acid coating. Sharp and strong diffraction signals at 2θ values of around 30.1°, 35.5°, 42.8°, 53.8°, 56.7° and 63.8° can be indexed to crystal planes of (220), (311), (400), (422), (511) and (440) respectively and matched well with the data base of crystalline iron oxide magnetite Fe3O4 nanoparticles.39,40
