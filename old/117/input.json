Preparation of NPs
For pure ZnO NPs, 0.5 mol of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (99.99%) were added to ammonium hydroxide (28–30%) to get a neutral pH value, stirred on a magnetic stirrer, and then treated ultrasonically to form the colloidal solution using double-distilled water (DDW). The resultant was then sedimented, filtered, washed many times, centrifuged, decanted, and dried for a few hours. The sample was annealed in a furnace, resulting in a ZnO NPs powder.
To prepare Fe-doped ZnO NPs, the same amount of Zinc acetate Zn(CH3COO)2 ·2H2O was mixed with a solution of 10% ferric chloride FeCl3·6H2O (97%) and followed the same way adopted for pure ZnO NPs. For glucose-capped ZnO NPs, 0.2-mole starch or glucose solution was used instead of ferric chloride and followed the same process.
Characterization
The XRD patterns were incorporated for their crystal structure, as shown in Fig. 1. The peaks at 2θ values 30.89°, 33.92°, 35.65°, 56.32°, 62.53°, 66.72°, 68.87°, and 76.07° are of respective [110], [111], [022], [202], [113], [020], [220], and [222] planes. All the figure peaks match the standard pattern for JCPDS card 01–074–0534 [27]. The peaks are sharp, indicating nanoparticles of the product and their high crystalline nature [28]. The broadness at the base of the peaks shows that the product is of tiny size. No other peaks are observed, which means almost no impurities indicate the formation of the anticipated materials. The average crystallite size of NPs is 10.1–17.8 nm, obtained from Debye–Scherer's formula [29].
The variations of the average crystallite sizes of the as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 2. ZnO and Fe-doped ZnO nanoparticles have average crystallite sizes of 21 nm and 17 nm, respectively. The calculated Lattice parameters, crystallite size (D) and the interplanar spacing (d) for values are summarized in Table 1, respectively.
The images below show the particles are spherical with a smooth surface and particle size. The TEM micrograph of all ZnO NPs is shown in Figs. 3(a) to (c). It is clear from the micrograph that as-synthesized pure, doped, and capped ZnO NPs exhibit spherical and hexagonal morphology [33]. The particles are slightly agglomerated with sizes 15 to 50 nm, respectively, close to the estimated size obtained from XRD.
