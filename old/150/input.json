Biosynthesis and extraction of AgNPs
By following the 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard, 10 % v/v inoculum of S. marcescens MTCC8708 was prepared using overnight grown (28 째C) colonies and inoculated in Erlenmeyer flask containing sterile Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. The flask was incubated at 28 째C for 24 h with continuous agitation at 150 rpm. After incubation, the supernatant was collected by centrifuging the suspension (Eppendorf 5810 R, Germany) for 20 min at 4000 rpm, following which 1 mM AgNO3 was added to it. A flask containing just the supernatant without the addition of AgNO3 was also prepared and considered for control. Both flasks were incubated overnight at 37 째C in shaking condition (150 rpm). The colour change from pale yellow to brown in the experimental flask was presumed as the formation of AgNPs[41]. Once the AgNPs were synthesized, an equal volume of acetone was added to the cell-free extract containing AgNPs and centrifuged for 20 min at 4000 rpm to form a slurry of AgNPs[42]. The slurry was then washed twice with acetone to remove any residual impurities or salts from the broth used previously. The slurry was collected and evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator (Buchi, Switzerland) at 50 째C under vacuum. A powdered form of AgNPs was collected and stored under ambient conditions for further applications and characterization.
The SEM images illustrated the uniform distribution of small dispersed spherical-shaped AgNPs sized between 14.7 and 20.8 nm ( Fig. 2 ). The size of the AgNPs obtained in the current study was smaller compared to the AgNPs synthesized using other bacterial strains [41] , [45] , [46] , [54] , [55] , [56] , [57] , [58] , [59] , [60] . It has been reported that smaller-sized NPs tend to display greater biological activities as they have better stability and larger surface area to interact with the surface of microorganisms, and therefore are easier to internalize due to lesser spatial hindrance [30] , [59] , [60] , [61] .
