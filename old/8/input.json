Synthesis of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles
Zinc oxide nanoparticles were synthesized using the procedure as described by Padalia and Chanda [13]. Fifty milliliters of leaf extract was taken in a beaker and heated at 80 °C on a magnetic stirrer heater. Five grams of zinc nitrate (ZnNO3) was then added to the leaf extract when the temperatures reached 80 °C. The mixture was heated until it was reduced to a deep yellow color paste. The paste was collected in a ceramic crucible and heated in a Muffle Furnace at 400 °C for 2 h. A light yellow color powder of ZnO NPs was obtained which was carefully collected and stored at 4 °C for further analysis.

2.4 Characterization of the Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles
Characterization of the synthesized ZnO NPs was carried out by various spectroscopy techniques like UV-Vis spectroscopy, zeta potential, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis as described by Padalia et al. [14].
UV-Vis spectroscopy serves as a preliminary tool to confirm the formation of nanoparticles. The synthesized ZnO NPs showed strong absorbance peak at 370 nm due to its surface plasmon resonance (Fig. 1a); this result confirmed the formation of ZnO NPs synthesized from the leaf extract of Cassia auriculata. The surface charge of synthesized ZnO NPs was 16.63 mv determined by zeta potential (Fig. 1b). This suggested that nanoparticles were positively charged and stable. 
X-ray diffraction analysis is use to confirm nature of ZnO NPs. The X-ray diffraction patterns of synthesized ZnO NPs are given in Fig. 3. XRD spectrum of synthesized ZnO NPs were showed the peaks at 2θ of 31.814°, 34.495°, 36.318°, 47.600°, 56.654°, 62.940°, 66.423°, 68.029°, and 69.116° could be attributed to the 100, 002, 101, 102, 110, 103, 200, 112, and 201 planes, respectively. All of the diffraction peaks confirm the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO NPs (JCPDS card no. 36-1451). The sharp strong and narrow diffraction intense peaks indicate that the synthesized ZnO NPs are highly crystalline.
The SEM images of ZnO NPs at different magnification of 10.05, 30.25, and 40.06 K are depicted in Fig. 4(a-d). The ZnO NPs were found to be predominantly spherical and irregular in shape. The average particle size of ZnO NPs was 68.64 nm.
