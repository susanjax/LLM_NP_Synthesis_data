Synthesis of AgNPs
P. indica was collected at Kanyakumari, India between January 2021 and February 2021. The aerial part of the plant was removed (100 gm), dried (sun drying) and powdered by mechanical grinding. The powdered material was used for the preparation of nanoparticles. About 1.0 g powder was suspended in 99 mL double distilled water and stirred for 2 h. It was filtered using a Whatman No 1 filter paper and used as the natural bioreductor for the preparation of silver nanoparticles. Plumbago extract has been widely used for the green synthesis of nanoparticles due to high phenolic content (
Singh et al., 2018). The plant extract (2 mL, 1%) was mixed with aqueous silver nitrate solution (100 mL, 1 mM), followed by microwave assisted green NPs synthesis (
Fatimah et al., 2018, Garibo et al., 2020). The development of NPs was monitored using UV–Visible spectra.
Hydroxyapatite doped – silver nanoparticles
The hydroxyapatite doped silver nanoparticles (HAp – AgNPs) was prepared by co-precipitation method. The HAp doped – AgNPs were synthesized from CaO as suggested previously with little modifications from Black Sumatra and Fighting cock with the atomic ratio of Ag/[Ag + Ca] was 0.2. Then it was dissolved in double distilled water (200 mL) and was continuously stirred at room temperature. To the solution, (NH4)2HPO4 was continuously added until the atomic ratio of [Ca + Ag]/P was 1.67. It was maintained at 150 °C for overnight in an oven and the final slurry was dried at 80 °C and finally HAp – AgNPs were obtained (
Zhou et al., 2020
,
Ciobanu et al., 2013
).

characterization of HAp – AgNPs
The bands occurred in the spectra of 1415, 1634 and 2354 cm−1 (
Fig. 4
). As described in
Fig. 5
, the doped HAp-Ag nanoparticles showed an ellipsoidal morphology in SEM analysis.
