synthesis and characterization of AuNps

AuNps were chemically synthesized in the presence of PAMAM or sodium citrate, leading to the formation of AuNps with diameters ranging from 7 to 20 nm, bearing positive and negative charges, respectively. Details on the synthesis of the Nps-PAMAM can be found elsewhere (Crespilho et al., 2007). Briefly, 2 mL of PAMAM G4 (0.07 mmol L−1) were added to 2 mL of HAuCl4 solution (1 mmol L−1) and 2 mL of formic acid 10% (v/v). This solution was mixed and shaked during 4 h. The color changed from yellow to red, indicating the zerovalent Au complex was formed after 4 h.

The AuNps-citrate were obtained by citrate reduction of gold salts, as previously described (Grabar et al., 1995). Briefly, 1.0 mL of 1% sodium citrate was added to 14 mL of boiling solution 0.5 mmol L−1 HAuCl4 with vigorous stirring. The final solution color changes to red–violet rapidly. The nanoparticle formation was monitored by UV–vis spectrophotometry (Hitachi U-2001 Spectrophotometer; San Jose, CA, USA). AuNPs morphology and particle size distribution were estimated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Model CM200; Philips, the Netherlands) by measuring at least 100 particles in TEM images using the program Image J (Java-Sun Microsystems). Typical AuNPs TEM images used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. The Zeta potential and the hydrodynamic diameter were measured (Malvern Zetasizer) before and after AuNp dilution into cell culture medium with serum (10% fetal bovine serum-FBS) (Table 1).
