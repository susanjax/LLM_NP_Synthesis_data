Synthesis of TiO2 NPs using the green extracts (G-TiO2 NPs)
Briefly, 0.50 M of TiCl4 (80 mL) was added to the green extracts (80 mL) and continuously stirred. The change of color from transparent to pale white was observed after 60 min due to the reduction of Ti4+, indicating the formation of NPs. Then, the precipitates were washed with ethyl alcohol, air dried, calcinated at 300 °C for 3 h and ground to obtain fine powder [29].
Characterization of TiO2 NPs 
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed the tetragonal and crystalline phase of TiO2NPs (Fig. 1B). The peaks at 2θ = 27.53°, 36.22°, 41.30°, 54.44°, 56.58°, 62.81° and 69.34° were assigned Miller indices (hkl) values to the (110), (101), (111), (211), (200), (002) and (301) set of lattice planes confirmed the rutile phase (calcined at 300 °C for 3 h). The widened peak was due to the presence of tiny particle size. The mean crystalline size of G-TiO2 NPs was 18.95 nm.
HR-TEM and SAED were used to predict the dimension, shape and topography of NPs. According to HR-TEM, G-TiO2 NPs were nanocrystalline, non-agglomerated particles having a tetragonal shape with size between 10−33 nm (Fig. 1E a,b). The SAED pattern recorded diffraction spots/rings with interplanar spacing that could be indexed according to tetragonal TiO2 rutile.
