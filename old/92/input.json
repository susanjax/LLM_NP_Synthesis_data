Preparation of Nanoparticles
MnClTPP-NPs and NiTPP-NPs were formulated via the single emulsion-solvent evaporation method (Figure 1C) [50]. This method is suitable for encapsulation of water-insoluble drugs [50]. Briefly, 10 mg of MnClTPP or NiTPP and mass of PLGA were dissolved in 2.5 mL of chloroform (for MnClTPP) and methylene chloride (for NiTPP), as the organic phase. Then, the mixture was added drop-by-drop to PVA solution. The emulsion was sonicated (Labsonic U.B.Braun, Melsungen, Germany) and then evaporated during 50 min under reduced pressure to remove the organic solvent (IKA HB10, Staufen im Breisgau, Germany). Further, NPs were collected via centrifugation for 1 h at 15,000× g, 4 °C and washed twice with distilled water following centrifugation at 17,000× g for 30 min (BECKMAN J2-2, Palo Alto, CA, USA). After centrifugation, the sediment was resuspended in 10 mL of distilled water; filtered using a glass filter with a porosity of 47–111 μm, and 10% (w/w) of D-mannitol was added to the suspension. The resulting NPs were lyophilized and stored at 4 °C until further use.
Characterization of NPs
Further, we analyzed the XRD patterns to study the physical state of pure MeP, PLGA, and NPs loaded with CoTPP, MnClTPP, and NiTPP. The sharp and intense peaks at 2-theta from 7° to 30° in the NiTPP and CoTPP XRD plots indicated their crystalline state (Figure 5A,C), which is in agreement with the results of Maclean et al. [60]. The peak at 2-theta of 14° evidenced the crystalline state of MnClTPP (Figure 5B). PLGA lacked intense peaks at 2-theta from 15° to 25°, displaying a dome-shaped region due to an amorphous state (Figure 5). These results agreed with those of previous studies [61]. The low relative amount of MeP loaded into NPs was expressed as a low intensity of XRD peaks, compared to free MeP. Probably, the PLGA XRD pattern partially masked the peaks of encapsulated MeP. Additionally, MePs in NPs could be of nano-range sizes and thus lack a long-range order, thus giving weaker lines in the XRD patterns. Nevertheless, MePs peaks were still recognizable. As a result, we concluded that the obtained samples were mostly in a crystalline rather than in an amorphous state.
