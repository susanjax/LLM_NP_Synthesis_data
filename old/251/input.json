Synthesis of plantaricin-incorporated silver nanoparticles (PL-SNPs)
Synthesis of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) was carried out by the method described by Adebayo-Tayo et al. [39] with slight modifications. PL-SNPs were prepared at room temperature by successive addition of freshly prepared 3 mM silver nitrate (15 μL) and 0.6 mM NaBH4 (100 μL) to 1 mL extracted plantaricin solution in water. Also, a free AgNB solution (without bacteriocin) was prepared. The obtained mixture was exposed to natural visible light. After 30 min, the degree of the mixture color turned from colorless to brown, which reflected the synthesis of silver nanoparticles.

The SEM micrographs of Plantaricin-incorporated Silver nanoparticles of PL-SNPs showed high density and spherical shaped nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 78.7 nm (Fig. 5).
With regard to SEM, it was revealed that the PL-SNPs particles have approximately spherical shapes with approximately mean diameter of 78.7 nm, which was approximately bigger than the mean diameter of 35 nm reported for the enterocin-coated silver nanoparticle [61].
