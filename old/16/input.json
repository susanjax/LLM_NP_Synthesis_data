Synthesis of nanoparticles
5 g of finely grounded plant powder was extracted with 100 ml of Milli Q water on boiling water bath for 30 min and were filtered with Whatmann no. 1 filter paper. An aliquot of 10 ml of aqueous plant extract was titrated with 100 ml of 5 mM CuSO4·5H2O for reduction of CuO NPs at 50 °C for 2 h. Obtained mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 RPM for 15 min to separate agglomerated, broad sized particles as well as plant admixtures.


Characterization of the NPs.
XRD analysis of synthesized nanoparticles showed 08 Bragg reflections at 2θ of X-axis at 32.4°, 35.6°, 38.8°, 48.9°, 53.3°, 58.2°, 61.6°, 66.3° corresponds to 110, 111, 200, −202, 020, 202, −113 and 022 integer ‘hkl’ planes, respectively (Fig. 4). This indicates end-centered monoclinic crystalline nature of nanoparticles. This result was affirmed by cross checking the obtained data with International centre for diffraction data (ICDD) file no. 80-1916. This type of results was obtained from an A. vera leaf extract mediated CuO NPs (Vijay Kumar et al. 2015). 
An ample resolution up to 2 nm is possible by high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) analysis. Because, focusing of 300 kV of electron beam energy is possible on nanoparticles. The 20 nm resolution studies with TEM analysis revealed that the particles were spherical in shape, non-agglomerated, polydispersed with the size range from 5 to 13 nm (Fig. 5b). The 2 nm resolution studies of nanoparticles showed 0.28 nm size of ‘d’ space. This result indicates the synthesized nanoparticles were crystalline in nature (Fig. 5c).
