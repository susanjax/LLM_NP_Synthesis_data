Synthesis of Fe3O4/ZrO2/ZnO NP
The magnetite iron oxide and Fe3O4/ZrO2 NP were prepared via the reported method in previous work [25]. For the synthesis of Fe3O4/ZrO2/ZnO NP, 0.1 mmol (0.02 g) of Zn(OAc)2 was dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol. Subsequently, NaOH was added (2:1 ratio of NaOH:Zn(OAc)2), and the measured pH reached to 11. Then, the obtained mixture was added to Fe3O4/ZrO2 suspension (0.03 g in 20 mL of ethanol) followed by sonication for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2.5 h and the brown–black powder was separated by a supermagnet and was washed with deionized water and ethanol. Finally, it was dried at 60 °C overnight and denoted as Fe3O4/ZrO2/ZnO NP.
Characterization
The morphology and size of Fe3O4/ZrO2/ZnO NP were investigated by FE-SEM analysis. Based on the FE-SEM images of Fe3O4/ZrO2/ZnO NP in Fig. 1, a spherical morphology with diameters of about 30–40 nm was seen for the synthesized NP. The observed agglomeration in these NP can be related to the magnetic interaction of the Fe3O4/ZrO2/ZnO NP, whose effect was produced by the magnetic interaction between the individual particles [28].
Identification of Fe3O4/ZrO2/ZnO NP was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The diffraction peaks of the synthesized NP were given in Fig. 3. The sharp diffraction peaks showed the crystalline phases of Fe3O4/ZrO2/ZnO NP. The diffraction peaks observed at 2θ ∼ 18.45 (111), 30.36 (220), 35.76 (311), 43.47 (400), 53.94 (422), 57.51 (511), 63.16 (440) and 74.76° (533) have shown the magnetic iron oxide planes according to JCPDS No. 00–049–1642. Also, the observed diffraction peaks at 2θ = 34.96 (200), 50.22 (220), and 59.74° (311) are related to cubic ZrO2 (JCPDS No. 00–027–0997). The diffraction peak of zinc(II) oxide is observed at 2θ = 30.78 (100) and 62.09° (103) which may be attributed to the hexagonal crystalline planes of zinc(II) oxide. The existence peaks of Fe3O4, ZrO2, and ZnO in the XRD pattern of Fe3O4/ZrO2/ZnO NP confirmed the formation of Fe3O4/ZrO2/ZnO NP. The average crystallite size of the synthesized NP was determined using Debye – Scherrer Eq. (2)
The crystallite size (D) was calculated using this equation, which incorporates the Scherer constant (k) of approximately 0.94, the wavelength (λ) of CuKα radiation (1.541 Å), the Bragg angle (θ) for the peak at 2θ, and the line broadness (β ) at full width at half maximum (FWHM) in radians). Based on the Debye–Scherrer equation the average crystallite size of Fe3O4/ZrO2/ZnO NP was approximately 10 nm.
