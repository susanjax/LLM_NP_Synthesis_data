2.2. Green synthesis of GA-Ag NPs
A stock solution of GA was produced in deionized (DI) water with continuous stirring to ensure complete solubilization. Subsequently, varying concentrations of GA ranging from 3 to 9 mg/mL were mixed with 9 mg/mL AgNO3 in a v/v ratio of 1:1. The resulting mixture was heated to a temperature of 65 °C. The color shift from light yellow to brown showed the formation of GA-Ag NPs. The synthesis of NPs was additionally confirmed using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-240, Hitachi U-3200).

2.3. Drug loading in GA-Ag NPs (GA-Ag-Q NPs)
To encapsulate quercitrin, an appropriate amount of GA-Ag NPs was re-dispersed in DI water of a known volume (20 mL) and 10 mg of quercitrin solution in methanol (5 mL) was mixed, yielding a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL of quercitrin in the NPs solution. The mixture was stirred magnetically at room temperature for 24 h. The Quercitrin-loaded GA-Ag-Q NPs were obtained in the form of palettes after 20 min of double centrifugation at 10,000 rpm.

2.4. Surface coating of GA-Ag-Q NPs with casein (GA-Ag-Q-Cs NPs)
To develop the surface coating with Cs, 10 mg (2 mg/mL) of Cs solubilized in water was added to GA-Ag-Q NPs and stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The surface-coated GA-Ag-Q-Cs NPs were collected by centrifugation for 20 min at 12,000 rpm. The synthesized GA-Ag-Q-Cs NPs were stored in light-resistant vials at 4 °C until their next use.

2.5. Surface coating of GA-Ag-Q NPs with polydopamine (GA-Ag-Q-PDA NPs)
PDA was prepared via self-polymerization of dopamine hydrochloride (DA-HCl) in the presence of a tris buffer (10 mM, pH 8.5) and vigorous stirring. As the dopamine was polymerized, the color of the solution turned dark brown, indicating the formation of PDA. To produce the surface-coated GA-Ag-Q-PDA NPs, 10 mL of a 2-mg/mL PDA solution was mixed with 2 mL of the as-prepared GA-Ag-Q NPs and stirred overnight. The resulting pellets were re-dispersed in DI water and kept at 4 °C until further use.

Characterization of NPs
Particle size distribution is an important consideration in drug design and the development of therapeutic nanomedicines. It determines in vivo distribution, targeting ability, and toxicity of NPs as well as in vitro stability. Furthermore, they can influence drug loading and release, as well as the solubility and stability of encapsulated drugs [38,39].
Table 1 summarizes the particle size, dispersion index, and zeta potential values of the optimized formulation and coated/uncoated analogs.

A narrow PDI (<0.3) indicates a homogenous particle distribution, and it is a dimensionless measurement that is used to evaluate the broad particle size distribution. GA-Ag NPs had a mean size of 144.2 ± 1.656 nm and a PDI value of 0.326 ± 0.037. GA-Ag-Q NPs, on the other hand, had a mean size of 208.93 ± 12.814 nm and a PDI value of 0.368 ± 0.024, respectively. The increase in size after drug loading supports the successful entrapment of quercitrin into GA-Ag NPs. PDI value less than 0.3, showing a wide polydispersity of the particle. Zeta potential is an additional important factor that affects the stability of nanocarriers. The NPs with small size and zeta value below or above -30 mV will confer and improve bioavailability significantly
[40]
. As shown in the
Table 1
, zeta potential of GA-Ag-Q NPs and GA-Ag NPs were -19.2 ± 0.98 mV and -14.8 ± 1.47 mV respectively. The high negative charge of drug-loaded NPs compared to their naked counterpart was most likely due to quercitrin's negative functional groups, demonstrating the successful loading of quercitrin into GA-Ag NPs.

Furthermore, surface coating of NPs with Cs and PDA resulted in size increases of 208.93 to 214.9 ± 3.350 nm and 208.93 ± 12.814 to 253.6 ± 3.355 nm, respectively. PDI value also changed from 0.368 ± 0.024 to 0.313 ± 0.027 and 0.24 ± 0.340, for Cs and PDA-coated NPs respectively. The increase in size is because of the successful deposition of bio-polymer on the surface of drug-loaded NPs. Furthermore, the surface potential of NPs changed from -19.2 ± 0.98 to -27.1 ± 0.75 and -21.6 ± 2.25 after coating with Cs and PDA, respectively. Casein-coated GA-Ag-Q-Cs NPs were determined to be the most stable of the four NPs, with a negative zeta value of -27.1 ±0.75 mV. Drug delivery systems with higher surface negativity are preferred as it enhances their physical stability and in vivo performance. Hence, all the optimized formulation complies with the requirement of the zeta potential for stability.

3.2. Surface morphology
SEM was used to analyze the shape and topography of NPs, as shown in
Fig. 1
. Thin films of the sample were analyzed using SEM images at magnifications of 1 and 2 μm, providing visual evidence for the combination of the coating material with drug-loaded NPs. Most of the empty NPs appear to be spherical in shape and exhibit no aggregation. While few of them are scattered with variable shapes and sizes, as illustrated in
Fig. 1
 (A). SEM images of the drug-loaded analog, on the other hand, revealed an irregular and random distribution with a variable increase in shape and size, shown in
Fig. 1
 (B). After surface coating with casein, the morphology and size of NPs were effectively modified, and we observed a significant increase in size with spherical geometry and uniform distribution of NPs without any aggregation, as depicted in
Fig. 1
(C), which was consistent with the DLS particle size measurements. The increased particle size of the Cs-modified drug-loaded NPs may be caused by the adsorption of Cs molecules on the surface of the encapsulated NPs by electrostatic interaction. However, it was interesting to observe that after surface modification with PDA, the NPs maintain their spherical integrity with a rough surface and no significant morphological difference was observed in comparison to the uncoated formulation, as shown in
Fig. 1
 (D). In contrast, the size of NPs has increased relative to the blank formulation.
