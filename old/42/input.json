synthesis of AuNPs
Cationic gold nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized as previously reported.38,39 (See Supporting Information for synthesis and characterization.)
2 nm diameter gold nanoparticles were synthetized by the Brust-Schiffrin two-phase methodology 1 using
pentanethiol as the stabilizer; these clusters were purified with successive extractions with ethanol and acetone. A
Murray place exchange reaction2 was carried out in dry DCM to functionalize the nanoparticles with each
ligand. 3 , 4 The monolayer-protected nanoparticles were redispersed in water and the excesses of
ligand/pentanethiol were removed by dialysis using a 10,000 MWCO snake-skin membrane. The final
concentration was measured by UV spectroscopy on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax M2 at 506nm according to
the reported methodology.5
We recently reported that 2 nm core cationic monolayer-protected AuNPs can interact with cell membrane of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, resulting in formation of distinct aggregation patterns and lysis of bacterial cell
