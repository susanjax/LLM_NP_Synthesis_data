Synthesis of ZnO NPs
An Erlenmeyer flask (100 mL) was engaged in which 70 mL of 0.2 M zinc acetate dihydrate (ZAD) solution (prepared in De-ionized water) and 30 mL of the extracellular fungal fraction were added. The flask was then set aside upon a magnetic stirrer with a hot plate, at around 70 °C together with a continuous stirring until the entire mixture was reduced to a fine gel/paste. The latter was made to dry overnight at a temperature of about 60 °C (utilizing a hot air oven) and then finely ground. It was further made to undergo calcination in a Bioevopeak (FNC-BX1200-P Series) Muffle Furnace, operating at a temperature of 500 °C for around 2 h. The end product was then cooled off under natural convection, judiciously collected, and stored in an airtight container that was placed at room temperature until further use (Senthilkumar and Sivakumar 2014).
Characterization of ZnO NPs
The PXRD analysis of ZnO NPs chronicled certain sharp, narrow, and intense diffraction peaks within the 2θ range of 10°–90°, hence, signifying a high percentage of crystalline phases inherent to the synthesized NPs (Haque et al. 2020; Rishikesan and Basha 2020). The PXRD Diffractogram for ZnO NPs supported certain major peaks corresponding to 2θ as were seen at 31.8°, 34.5°, 36.2°, 47.6°, 56.7°, 62.9°, 66.3°, 68.2°, 69.2°, 72.5°, 77°, 81.3°, and 89.5°, thereby suggesting the presence of respective Bragg’s planes of diffraction viz. [1,0,0], [0,0,2], [1,0,1], [1,0,2], [1,1,0], [1,0,3], [2,0,0], (Abdelhakim et al. 2020; Abdelhakim et al. 2020; Abdo et al. 2021), [2,0,1], [0,0,4], [2,0,2], [1,0,4], and [2,0,3]. The latter was substantiated with the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) card file number-01-084-6785 and is well illustrated in Fig. 5.
The typical diffraction peaks are testified to be in the same line with the characteristics outlining distinctive wurtzite kind of polycrystals and have an innate hexagonal phase (Rajakumar et al. 2018; Rishikesan and Basha 2020).
The average crystallite size came out to be approximately 58 nm (Ebadi et al. 2019).
A virtual hexagonal morphology in context to the shape of NPs was primarily recorded by the FESEM micrograph (Sumanth et al. 2020; Khan et al. 2021; Vignesh et al. 2021; Rajakumar et al. 2018). It was observed that the individual NPs are somewhat placed together embracing a cauliflower-like pattern. The diverse-sized NPs were accompanied by some unevenly distributed large-sized chunks or were themselves held as agglomerates which are well represented in Fig. 7 (Chaudhuri and Malodia 2017; Rajakumar et al. 2018; Sumanth et al. 2020; Rajendran et al. 2021).
