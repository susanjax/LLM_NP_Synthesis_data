2.2. Preparation of sulfur nanoparticles
Sulfur nanoparticles (SNPs) were prepared using elemental sulfur (S0) and sodium sulfide following the procedure shown in Fig. 1 . For this, 20 mL of 1 M sodium sulfide was heated to 100 °C and followed by the addition of 1.6 g of elemental sulfur reacted for 1 h with vigorous stirring. The yellow color of elemental sulfur turned reddish-orange, indicating the formation of polysulfide and designated as SNPES ( Guo et al., 2006 , Paralikar and Rai, 2017 , Soleimani et al., 2013 ). Then 40 mL of a 0.5 wt% chitosan solution (dissolved in 1% acetic acid) was added to the polysulfide solution, and an 18 wt% hydrochloric acid solution was added dropwise with stirring until the color of the solution turned into milky white. The formed nanoparticles were collected by precipitation using a centrifuge and washed three times with distilled water until the pH reached 7. The final product was dried at 50 °C and designated SNPES. For comparison, spherical SNPs were prepared using the acidification method of sodium thiosulfate according to the method described previously ( Shankar et al., 2018 , Chaudhuri and Paria, 2011 ). Briefly, 2.482 g of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate was dissolved in 900 mL distilled water and added 100 mL of dilute HCl (0.2 M) with stirring. As described in previous reports ( Shankar et al., 2018 , Shankar and Rhim, 2018 ), for coating with chitosan, the precipitated SNPs were washed and dispersed in 50 mL of 0.5 wt% chitosan solution with stirring for 1 h. The SNPs were collected, washed until the pH reached 7, and dried as described above and designated SNPSTS (see Fig. 2 ).

The morphology of SNPs prepared with different sulfur compound sources was observed using TEM, and the TEM image and size distribution of SNPs are shown in Fig. 3 . The shape and size of the SNPs depended on the sulfur source and manufacturing method. The SNPs prepared by the acidification of sodium thiosulfate (SNPSTS) have a spherical shape with an average particle size of 17 nm, while the SNPs made with elemental sulfur (SNPES) have a rod-shape with an average length and diameter of 87 and 22 nm, respectively.

With regard to the various molecular structures and allotropes of sulfur, the allotropic form of the synthesized SNPs should be determined. XRD analysis was performed to determine the allotropic form of the SNPs, and the XRD patterns of elemental sulfur and the synthesized SNPs are shown in Fig. 4 . The position and intensity of the diffraction peaks of the SNPs are in good agreement with the XRD patterns of SNPs having an orthorhombic (α) S8 structure of sulfur ( Choudhury et al., 2013c , Xie et al., 2012 ). However, the allotropic forms of SNPs may vary depending on the sulfur source and preparation method of SNPs.
