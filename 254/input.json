Synthesis of capped AgNPs/MA
Silver precursor i.e. silver salt (AgNO3) was prepared by Turkevich method which provides free Ag+ ions in reaction medium. Trisodium Citrate (Na3C6H5O7) was incorporated as the reducing agent and malonic acid was applied as capping agent. In a 10 mL capacity flask, 1 mL of 4 mM Tri Sodium Citrate was added first and heated to 70 °C, then dropwise mixture of 0.1 M NaOH (0.5 mL) and malonic acid (7 mL) was added under vigorous stirring on magnetic stirrer, for 10 min. A total of 1 mL silver nitrate solution (10%) was added dropwise in the mixture. The content was stirred for another 15 min or till the color changes to pale yellow. The color change was observed from colorless to bright yellow.
In another set of synthesis experiment, NaBH4 was used as reducing agent followed by capping with malonic acid to produce AgNPs/MA. Ice-chilled 2 mM NaBH4 (1 mL) was added to a 10 mL reaction flask and a mixture of solutions (7 mL of malonic acid solution and 0.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH) was added dropwise under constant stirring. Later, 1 mL (10%, of AgNO3 solution) was added dropwise.
The solution turned from colorless to bright yellow and was attributed to formation of AgNPs. The synthesized AgNPs/MA solution was stored in the dark at 4 °C. The resultant product was analyzed by UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Model number UV-1800 Parma Spec., Shimadzu, Japan), in the absorbance range of 300–800 nm wavelength (

 Synthesis of AgNPs/MA generated by hot process (reduction by trisodium citrate)
Synthesis of AgNPs was performed with various combinations of AgNO3 (0.5–1 mM) and MA molarities (0.25–4 mM), time (1–10 min.) and pH (3–11). Three AgNO3 concentrations (0.5 mM, 0.75 mM and 1.0 mM) were added to MA concentrations 0.25, 2.12 and 4.0 mM and observed for 5, 10 and 15 min. The maximum absorbance of AgNPs was recorded as 412 nm. The optimized conditions were found as: 0.5 mM AgNO3 with 2.12 mM MA for 5 min (
Fig. 1
a); 0.75 mM AgNO3 with 2.12 mM MA for 10 min. (
Fig. 1
b); and 1 mM AgNO3 with 2.12 mM for 15 min. (
Fig. 1
c). Whereas pH 11 shows the optimum synthesis of capped AgNPs (

. Synthesis of AgNPs/MA generated by cold process (reduction by NaBH4)
Similarly, three AgNO3 concentrations (0.5 mM, 0.75 mM and 1.0 mM) were mixed with three concentrations of MA (0.25 mM, 2.12 mM and 4.0 mM) in various combinations and observed for 1 to 3 min. The AgNPs maximally absorbed the incidence light at 397 nm. The data revealed optimum production of AgNPs in the following amalgamations: (i)0.5 mM AgNO3 + 4 mM MA with a reaction time of 1 min. (
Fig. 2
a), (ii) 0.75 mM + 2.12 mM MA for 3 min. (
Fig. 2
b), and (iii) 1 mM AgNO3 + 4 mM with a reaction time of 35 min. (
Fig. 2
c). While assessing the impact of reaction pH, pH 11 maximally enhanced the production of AgNPs followed by pH 8 and pH 9 (
Fig. 2
d).

Dynamic light scattering and zeta potential
DLS analysis determined the colloidal nature of AgNPs in the suspension with only one signal between 10 and 100 nm (
Fig. 5
a,b). Z-average size distribution curve provided the information that synthesized and stabilized H-AgNPs/MA and C-AgNPs/MA were poly-dispersed in nature, with average diameter of 123.6 nm and 111.4 nm, respectively and PDI value were measured as 0.488 and 0.468 for H-AgNPs/MA and C-AgNPs/MA, respectively (
Fig. 5
a,b).

Scanning and transmission electron microscopy
The synthesized and capped AgNPs were predominantly spherical in shape. The average size based on the 50 readings of individual nanoparticles showed an average size of 20 nm by TEM (
Fig. 6
a). The diameter of the nanoparticle aggregates was found less than 100 nm in size by SEM. The SEM images also suggested that the produced nanoparticles were uniform in shape (
Fig. 6
b).
