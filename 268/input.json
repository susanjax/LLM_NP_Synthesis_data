Biological synthesis of AgNPs
Spores of G. striatum DSM 10335 from 14-day-old cultures on potato dextrose agar slants were used to prepare the fungal inoculum in Sabouraud dextrose broth. G. striatum inoculum was cultivated for 72 h at 28 °C on a rotary shaker at 160 rpm.
The fungal biomass was filtered through sterile filter paper and washed three times with sterile deionized water. The washed G. striatum biomass was transferred to a sterile flask and suspended in sterile deionized water in an amount equivalent to the previous Sabouraud medium. The G. striatum mycelium was re-incubated for 96 h at 28 °C on a rotary shaker at 160 rpm. Subsequently, the mycelium was filtered through sterile filter paper and the post-culture liquid was sterilized using sterile disposable filter units with an SFCA membrane. The G. striatum sterile filtrate was supplemented with a stock solution of silver nitrate, which was prepared in sterile deionized water. The final concentration of silver ions in the G. striatum filtrate was 5 mM. Adequate controls were performed without the addition of silver nitrate. Additionally, samples containing sterile deionized water supplemented with 5 mM of Ag+ were prepared. All samples were incubated for 48 h at 28 °C in the dark on a rotary shaker at 160 rpm. The pH of the fungal filtrate was monitored using a pH-meter (Mettler Toledo, USA) both before and after the addition of the nanoparticles precursor.

The UV-Vis spectrum of the fungal post-culture liquid supplemented with silver nitrate revealed a peak with a λmax at 425 nm, characteristic of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of silver nanoparticles (

B). The efficiency of nanoparticles production was 14 × 1012 particles per mL. FT-IR analyses showed the presence of prominent bands at 1644.10 and 660.58 cm−1 and slight bands at 1200.45 and 2162.58 cm−1 (

C). The formation of silver nanoparticles was also studied using scanning electron microscopy. The SEM images revealed homogeneous spherical silver nanoparticles (
Fig. 1
D), and the measurement of their size distribution revealed silver nanoparticles with an average diameter of 20.2 ± 3.8 nm (

E). The composition of the obtained AgNP colloid was determined by elemental analysis using SEM–EDS spectrometry (
Fig. 1
F). The presence of silver, nitrogen, carbon, oxygen and silicon was confirmed. Silicon was detected as a result of AgNP imaging on a silicon wafer. The size of the obtained AgNPs was also measured by multiangle dynamic light scattering techniques (MADLS). The diameter determined using MADLS was 21.5 ± 6.67 nm, which is consistent with the size of nanoparticles specified with SEM (
