Preparation of Nanoparticles
Brust–Schiffrin method was employed for two phase synthesis of chemical GNPs [41]. Besides, for the case of biologically synthesized GNPs, gold salt solution was heated at 25 °C to which plant extract was added dropwise. Visible colour change from gold to dark blue/black was observed in all solutions indicating reduction of gold salt and formation of nanoparticles.
Characterization of Synthesized GNPs
The formation and stabilization of GNPs in the colloidal solution can be determined via UV–Visible spectral analysis. In our case, the biologically synthesised GNPs are basically formed by the reduction of gold metal salt by the extracts of tulsi plant and chemical reduction of trisdodium citrate that yields citrate capped GNPs. UV–Visible spectral analysis revealed the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak was situated at around 525 and 505 nm for chemically synthesized cGNPs (C-AuNPs) and biologically synthesized bGNPs (G-AuNPs) respectively (Fig. 1). 
SEM analysis showed variation in the size as well as dispersion of synthesized GNPs. While the cGNPs seemed to be in an aggregated state, bGNPs were quite well dispersed with an average size of 5–10 nm, whereas the cGNPs were of an average diameter of 20–35 nm (Fig. 3). TEM images of synthesized C-AuNPs and G-AuNPs are shown in Fig. 4a, b, respectively. The GNPs synthesized using the extract of tulsi leaves were observed to be quite monodispersed and of uniform size. The average size of bGNPs was found to be in the range of 2–10 nm. On the contrary, TEM analysis of cGNPs showed polydispersity with average ranging from 5 to 20 nm. The cGNPs were quiet heterogeneous with some being spherical, hexagonal and oval in shape. The electron microscopy data thus signified that the extracts from tulsi plant served the dual role of reduction and stabilization of GNPs, assisting in formation of quite stable and small sized particles. Reports suggest the high stability and small size of GNPs synthesized from tulsi plant, conferred by the binding of C=O groups of carboxylic acid onto the NP surface [44]. This thus renders an overall negative charge on the particle surface, provide efficient electrostatic repulsion, thereby prevent particle aggregation.
