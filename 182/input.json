Fungal extract preparation and biogenic synthesis of PR-CuO NPs
To prepare ethyl acetate extract of Penicillium radiatolobatum (PR), a 60 h old culture of previously isolated endophytic fungus (P. radiatolobatum strain AN003, NCBI accession no. MW237703.1 isolated form Quercus rubera L. plant) was innoculated (7-8 pieces of 5 mm disc) in 1 L of PDB and grown in a static condition for 2 weeks at 26 ± 2 °C. Following incubation, the fungal mycelia were removed from the culture broth by Whatman no. 1 filter paper. Then, the culture filtrate was mixed with ethyl acetate in a ratio of 1:3 and extracted the organic compounds thrice by collecting the upper (organic) layer using a separatory funnel. The extracts were pooled together and concentrated under reduced pressure at 37 °C using a rotary evaporator. Finally, the concentrated PR is collected and stored at 4 °C.

To synthesize PR-CuO NPs, 10 mL of PR (2 mg/mL) was added with 90 mL of copper nitrate (5 mM) solution and stirred overnight at 40 ± 2 °C in dark. After that, the reaction mix is heated at 75–80 °C for 2 h and allowed to cool down at room temperature. Then, the dark brown colored colloid mix was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was removed. Furthermore, pellet was washed 3–4 times with distilled water by centrifugation, lyophilized and final PR-CuO NPs was collected.

2.3. Preparation of PEGylated PR-CuO nanoparticles
To prepare PEGylated PR-CuO nanoparticles (PEG-PR-CuO NPs), PEG-3350 (500 mg) and PR-CuO NPs (100 mg) were dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water, separately. Furthermore, both the solutions were mixed, sonicated for 5 min (Vibra-Cell™, Sonics & Materials Inc., USA), stirring (120 rpm) for 6 h and left the solution for overnight without stirring at room temperature. After incubation, the colloid mix was centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 rpm, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was gathered by washing with water three times. Finally, the collected PEG-PR-CuO NPs pellet was lyophilized and stored at 4 °C for subsequent experiments. All the above procedures were carried out in the ambient dark condition.

Characterization 
The crystalline nature of PR-CuO and PEG-PR-CuO NPs was confirmed by XRD analysis and the diffractogram is shown in 
Fig. 1
. The diffraction peaks of CuO NPs at 2θ angle (°) of 32.5, 35.5, 38.7, 46.2, 48.7, 53.4, 58.2, 61.5, 66.2, 68.0, 72.3, and 74.9 were matched with the Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standard (JCPDS (048–1548)) and indexed to planes 110, -111, 111, −112, 202, 020, 202, 020, −113, 202, 311, and 004, respectively. Meanwhile, PEG-PR-CuO NPs flaunted the diffraction peaks at 32.5, 35.5, 38.7, 46.2, 48.7, 53.4, 58.2, 61.5, 66.3, 72.3, and 75.0 of 2θ angle (°), corresponding to the similar crystal planes as CuO NPs as matched with the JCPDS (048–1548). The sharpness of the diffraction evidenced the monoclinic cubic structure and phase purity of the tested samples (PR-CuO and PEG-PR-CuO NPs) [10]. However, the reduction in the intensity of PEG-PR-CuO NPs compared to PR-CuO NPs might be due to the PEGylation on the surface of PR-CuO NPs [28]. Some previous studies have also reported similar observations [16,34,35].

The surface architecture, size distribution, and elemental composition of PR-CuO and PEG-PR-CuO NPs were examined by TEM and displayed in 
Fig. 4
a–f. In TEM analysis, most PR-CuO NPs were observed with oval shapes (
Fig. 4
a) and a predominant size range of 30–90 mm (
Fig. 4
b). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) mapping unveiled the presence of Cu, oxygen (O), and carbon (C) elements in PR-CuO NPs sample (
Fig. 4
c and 
Supplementary Figs. 1a–d
). However, TEM analysis of PEG-PR-CuO NPs demonstrated their spherical and oval shapes (
Fig. 4
d) in the predominant size range of 40–110 nm (
Fig. 4
e). Also, the EDS mapping evidenced the profusion of elemental Cu, O, and C in the PEG-PR-CuO NPs sample (
Fig. 4
f and 
Supplementary Figs. 1e–h
). Besides, analysis of weight (%) and atomic (%) of the elemental compositions detected in PR-CuO and PEG-PR-CuO NPs during EDS mapping is summarized in the 
Supplementary Table 1
. Compared to PR-CuO NPs, the increase in the size range of PEG-PR-CuO NPs could probably due to the PEG decoration on bare PR-CuO NPs. Moreover, the larger size of CuO and PEG-PR-CuO NPs in DLS analysis (
Fig. 3
a&c) compared to TEM analysis could be due to hydrodynamic coating and agglomeration of NPs in an aqueous state [
38
]. Inflated morphological uniformity and lesser agglomeration of PEG-PR-CuO NPs might accredit to PEG, which extends free hydroxyl groups on NPs' surfaces and facilitates electrostatic stabilization [
35
].
