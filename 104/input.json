Nanoparticle preparation

In this study, dextran-coated SPIONs (Dex-SPIONs) were synthesized following a protocol previously described.14 Briefly, a mixture of 2.508 g Dex T70 (molecular weight 70 kD; Life Science Products, Chestertown, MD, US) and 3.044 g iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (Aladdin, Shanghai, China) dissolved in 20 mL of deionized water was put into a three-neck flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer. To this mixture was added a freshly prepared aqueous solution containing 1.27 g of ferrous chloride tetrahydrate (Aladdin) dissolved in 2 mL deionized water. While being rapidly stirred, 20 mL 7.5% ammonium hydroxide solution was slowly dropped into the mixture under argon protection. Then, the suspension was heated to 75°C and maintained at this temperature for 30 minutes while being stirred constantly. The black suspension was cooled and centrifuged at a speed of 1,500 rpm for 15 minutes to separate big particles. The ammonium chloride, excess ammonia, and Dex were removed by dialysis using citrate buffer. Characterization of Dex-SPIONs was performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM; 2100F; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Dynamic light scattering was used to analyze ζ-potential and hydrodynamic size (Zetasizer Nano ZS90; Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK).
In this study, Dex was used as coating material for SPIONs because of its good biocompatibility. Dex-SPIONs have been used in clinical applications.17 The size of the Dex-SPIONs was determined by TEM and dynamic light scattering. As shown in Figure 1A, Dex-SPIONs had a uniform morphology with some agglomerates, and the diameter was about 5–10 nm. Further study discovered the mean hydrodynamic size was about 60 nm (Figure 1B). Their ζ-potential was approximately −11 mV (Figure 1C), indicating their negative charge at physiological pH.
