 Synthesis of CuO nanoparticles
In order to prepare 0.1 M solution, we used 100 ml of distilled water to dissolve 2.54 g of copper sulfate pentahydrate while continuously stirring at 150 rpm for 2 h to form a complete homogeneous solution. The green extract of C. deodara was added dropwise with the help of the burette at continuous stirring. The solution was kept in dark place for 5 days until the green color of the solution changed into dark brown. This change in color prompted reduction of copper and copper oxide was formed. A centrifuge set at 4000 rpm for 15 min was used to remove the bio compound attached to the metal nanoparticles. After washing three times with water and acetone the formed nanoparticles were kept in the oven for aging at 70 °C for 12 h. The well-dried copper oxide nanoparticles were annealed at 500 °C for 2 h and were stored in an airtight bottle for further characterization.
