Synthesis of silver nanoparticles using E. Abbyssinica extracts
AgNPs were prepared according to modified literature methods [
[22]
,
[23]
]. In brief, 10 cm3 of the aqueous E. Abbyssinica extract was added to 90 cm3 of 1 mM silver nitrate solution in a 250 cm3 conical flask. The mixture was heated in a water bath set at 80 °C for 10 min. A colour change from yellow to brown was observed as the reduction of Ag+ to Ag0 occurred. The particles were separated by centrifuge at 4500 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was collected by decanting. The silver nanoparticles were precipitated with 80% ethanol and collected using centrifuge at 4500 rpm for 15 min. The final washing was done by absolute ethanol and dried in an oven at 40 °C for 15 min. The synthesised nanoparticles from the distilled water extract were labelled AgNP1. The procedure was repeated using methanol and acetone plant extracts. The AgNPs from methanol and acetone extracts were labelled AgNP2 and AgNP3, respectively.

. Effect of pH on green synthesis of silver nanoparticles
The effect of pH on the phyto-synthesis was studied using the E. abbyssinica methanol extract. In this work, methanol proved to be a better solvent for the extraction of the reducing and capping agents. The capacity of the phyto-chemicals to reduce Ag+ to Ag0 increases upon addition of the hydroxide ions to the solution. As shown in
Fig. 3
, the absorbance peak shifted towards longer wavelengths with increase in pH. This also shows that particle size of the synthesised nanoparticles increased with increase in pH. In this study the favourable pH was found to be 13.

Scanning electron microscopy analysis
The surface topography and morphology of the synthesised silver nanoparticles was examined using scanning electron microscopy with 4000 X magnification.
Fig. 7
 shows the images of the silver nanoparticles. The particles size ranged from 8.4 nm to 10 nm for the AgNP1, AgNP2 and AgNP3. The silver nanoparticles synthesised using the water extract had the smallest particle size compared to those obtained from methanol and ethanol extract. The results are comparable to those of silver nanoparticles synthesised using Calliandra haematocephala leaf extract [

].
