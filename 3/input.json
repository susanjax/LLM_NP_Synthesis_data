Preparation of ZnFe2O4 Magnetic Nanoparticles.
ZnFe2O4 MNPs were prepared using a hydrothermal method
as described elsewhere.25 Briefly, ZnCl2 (0.34 g, 2.5 mmol) and
FeCl3·6H2O (1.35 g, 5 mmol) were dissolved in ethylene glycol
(40 mL) to form a clear solution, followed by the addition of
NaAc (3.6 g) and polyethylene glycol 20 000 (1.0 g). The
mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 min and then sealed in a
teflonlined stainless-steel autoclave (50 mL capacity). The
autoclave was heated to and maintained at 200 °C for 8 h and
allowed to cool to room temperature. The black products were
washed several times with ethanol and dried at 60 °C for 6 h.
Characterization of ZnFe2O4 MNPs. The as-prepared
ZnFe2O4 MNPs were identified from the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns (Figure S1a, Supporting Information) with a
suitable spinel structure (JCPDS 22-1012). Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure S2, Supporting Information) revealed that ZnFe2O4 MNPs were spherical and
dispersive with an average size of about 200 nm. The magnetic
property of ZnFe2O4 MNPs was investigated at 298 K using a
vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Figure S3 (Supporting
Information) showed that the magnetization hysteresis loops
appeared S-like and the saturation magnetization was 65
emu·g−1
. Figure S4 (Supporting Information) showed the
variation of zeta potential of ZnFe2O4 MNPs with equilibrium
pH. The obtained zeta potential value of ZnFe2O4 MNPs
decreased with the increase of pH, and the isoelectrical point
(IEP) was about 4.8. The value of zeta potential is 4.92 mV at
pH 4.0, suggesting the surface of ZnFe2O4 MNPs has positive
charge at the pH.
