Biosynthesis of AgNPs of Spirulina sp. (Ssp-AgNPs) and S. Subsalsa (Ss-AgNPs)
Two lots of 10 mg of dried biomass of Ssp and Ss separately were roughly mixed at 40° C for 24 hrs (
Sahoo et al., 2020
). An aliquot of one milliliter of AgNO3 in a 1 mM solution was added to the aqueous medium. The reaction color was monitored every hour for 48 hrs. When the color of the incubated mixture changed from pale green to deep brown, the lot was repeatedly centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min (
Sahoo et al., 2020
). After centrifuging the mixture with AgNPs for 10 min., the individual final pellets were dried at 40° C for ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–vis), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), spectral characterizations. The visible colour change was verified by UV–visible spectrophotometry, which obtained spectral readings at 432 nm and 458 nm for Ssp-AgNPs and Ss-AgNPs, respectively.
The morphology of the nanoparticles was assessed by FESEM analysis (
Fig. 4
). The smaller particles in the FESEM investigation had aggregated to form a larger particle-like appearance. As revealed by SEM investigation, the dispersion of silver nanoparticles on the surface grid amply illustrates the morphological regularity. SEM tests indicated that the O. princeps extract generated spherical AgNP units with diameters ranging from 100–200 nm during the manufacture of O. princeps-AgNPs (
Bishoyi et al., 2021
). The synthetic Spirulina-AgNPs used in this investigation had a quasi-spherical form and ranged in size from 40-50 µm.

The DLS distribution of Spirulina AgNPs size was found to range between 30 and 60 nm, however, the previous results were with an average computed size of 26.57 nm and a maximum mean intensity of 3.02 % found to be consistent with the dispersed light intensity value of 976.11 or the mean intensity value of 16.93 (
Bishoyi et al., 2021
). Pedalium murex produced biogenic AgNP with an average DLS of 73.14 nm (
Bishoyi et al., 2021
).
