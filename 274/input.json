Synthesis of nanoparticles
Iron nanoparticles were synthesized by the microwave-induced precipitation method by taking 100 mL of ferrous chloride and ferric chloride (FeCl2 and FeCl3) (1 : 1.5 M), to which sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (3 M) was added drop-wise. The grayish black mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 4 hours with constant stirring (500 rpm). The mixture was allowed to settle, and the upper water was removed. The residue was washed frequently with distilled water till pH = 7. The resultant black residue was dried overnight in the oven (50 °C) to obtain iron nanoparticles. A similar procedure was adopted for the synthesis of copper, zinc, and chromium nanoparticles.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) thoroughly investigated the morphology of iron nanoparticles. Fig. 3 shows the SEM image and operation parameters used for studying the morphology of iron nanoparticles. The nanoparticles appear to be cubic and agglomerated. The observed agglomeration of iron nanoparticles could be due to electrostatic interactions between nanoparticle surface layers. Furthermore, nanoparticles tend to agglomerate in suspension because of their high surface area-to-volume ratio. The magnified image shows that the particles have a nanometer size.

The XRD analysis of iron, zinc, copper, and chromium nanoparticles is represented in Fig. 4. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the non-functionalized iron nanoparticles shows various peaks at 2θ = 17.8° (111), 30.0° (220), 35.2° (311), 43.2° (400), 53.2° (422), 57.0° (511), 62.5° (440) and 74.7° (533), which shows a crystal plane and cubic crystal geometry and is related to JCPSD card no. (65-3107). Similarly, the XRD pattern for the synthesized zinc NPs (Fig. 4) shows crystal planes and hexagonal crystal geometry according to JCPSD card no. 01-007-2551. The XRD pattern of copper NPs reveals a monoclinic crystal system (JCPDS card no. 45-0937), while the XRD pattern of Cr2O3 NPs shows rhombohedral crystal shape geometry according to JCPDS (card no. 74-0326) ascribed to the peaks present. The Scherer equation (intense peaks) was used to calculate the particle size, and the average particle sizes for Fe, Zn, Cu, and Cr NPs were found to be 62 nm, 19 nm, 18 nm, and 17 nm, respectively.
