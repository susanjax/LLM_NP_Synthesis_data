Synthesis of silver nanoparticles
Synthesis of AgNPs was done by preparing 5 mM of aqueous solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3). 5 mL of extract of P. americana fruit pulp was added to 45 mL of 5 mM AgNO3 solution for bio-reduction process at room temperature in dark condition and allowed. Incubation for 24 h. Change in colour from yellow to brown markedly shows the reduction of AgNPs thus indicating the formation of AgNPs. Centrifugation is done using Remi CM-12 PLUS cooling micro centrifuge at 4,500 rpm for 20 min to purify the produced AgNPs. Supernatant was disposed and the obtained pellets was washed thoroughly with double distilled water to wash away the unreacted AgNO3 and the extract. Then air-dried refined pellets were collected and analyzed by further characterization (

).

The XRD pattern of the biogenic AgNPs is shown in
Fig. 3b
. Multiple peaks were obtained at 2θ values of 38.29°, 44.42°, 64.64°, and 77.60°, corresponding to (1 0 0), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) planes of the face centered cubic (fcc) structure of crystalline silver, respectively. The peak corresponding to the (1 0 0) plane was more intense than the other planes suggesting it as the predominant orientation (

).

 and

 show the transmission electron micrographs of the synthesized AgNPs. The average sizes of the particles ranged from 20 nm to 50 nm and they seemed to be polydisperse in nature.
