Synthesis of AuNPs and AgNPs using a bio-fabrication method
One pot synthesis of Au and Ag nanoparticles using D. brittonii extract was carried out as follows: Synthesis of AuNPs was performed with HAuCl4 and aqueous D. brottonii extract. Briefly, 5 ml of DB plant extract was mixed with 45 ml of aqueous solution of 10-3 M HAuCl4. The color of the reaction solution changed immediately in the solution, and then the reaction mixture was kept on a hot plate at 35 °C, and stirred for 30 min to completely reduce metal ions in the solution. This was done to enhance the interaction of non-reduced ions with plant compounds present in the medium. For the synthesis of AgNPs, 5 ml of plant extract was mixed with an AgNO3 (10-3 M) solution. The mixture solution appeared as a yellowish-brown color within 15 min, which indicated the silver nanoparticle synthesis process in the mixture (
Tamuly et al., 2013
). The synthesized nanoparticle solution was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting pellets were freeze-dried and stored at 4 °C until further use. Also, the synthesized reaction mixture was optimized using three parameters, including pH, extract quality, and metal salt concentration. These parameters influenced the size and structure of AuNPs and AgNPs synthesized using a green synthesis procedure.

The powder XRD patterns of the biosynthesized DB gold and silver nanoparticles, as reported in
Fig. 6
ii. XRD diffraction peaks and planes were observed at 2θ = 38.2˚, 44.6˚, 66.3˚ and 77.5˚ corresponding to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) respectively, which reflected the gold nanocrystals presence in the DB synthesized AuNPs. Similarly, the XRD spectrum of DB-AgNPs confirmed that the nanoparticles were crystalline in nature, as shown by the obtained peak and planes of 2θ = 33.4˚, 46.5˚, 49.8˚ and 78.6˚ corresponding to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 0), and these results were similar to the XRD pattern of AuNPs and AgNPs of previously published studies. In addition, the obtained XRD characteristic peaks conformed to standard ICDD data (JCPDS card no. 04–784, 89–3722 for gold and silver respectively). In addition, some addition peaks of face-centered cubic (fcc) gold and silver nanocrystals were observed at 28.1 and 41.3, which could indicate the presence of bioactive metabolites in the DB extract. The XRD diffractogram, in particular, revealed peaks of the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (3 1 1) planes, which corresponded to biosynthesized AuNPs and AgNPs using various plant extracts (
Hemlata et al., 2020
,
Nadagouda et al., 2014
). Similarly,
Francis et al. (2017)
 claimed that the XRD patterns of AgNPs-SS and AuNPs-SS produced diffraction peaks corresponding to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) planes of fcc crystal of nano-Ag and nano-Au and respective 2θ values at 37.42˚, 44.16˚, 64.44˚ and 77.29˚ (JCPDS file no. 4–0783) and 37.74˚, 44.16˚, 64.61˚ and 77.49˚ (JCPDS file no. 4–0784) respectively.
Wang et al. (2016)
 also noted that, the crystalline structure of the biosynthesized AgNPs and AuNPs shows diffraction peaks at 38.19˚, 44.34˚, 64.48˚ and 77.46˚ are assigned to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) lattice planes found to be identical to those reported for silver NPs, and XRD peaks at 38.09˚, 44.40˚, 64.56˚ and 77.60˚ set of lattice planes were observed that indexed to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) faces of gold NPs. There are no different crystal phases on the surface of the AuNPs and AgNPs, which indicates no impurities including, Au3+ and Ag+ ions within the plant extract mixture.

The DB-AuNPs and DB-AgNPs of size, morphology, and particle distribution nature of the nanoparticles at different magnifications using HR-TEM are presented in
Fig. 4
a and 4b. The DB synthesized Au and Ag nanoparticles were typically spherical, relatively uniform, and well dispersed. The particle size distribution diagram was drawn from Image J using TEM images of nanoparticles that calculated the average particle size of approximately 18 and 30 nm for gold and silver nanoparticles, respectively (
Fig. 4
a and 4b, (inserts)). The FFT of green synthesized DB-AuNPs and DB-AgNPs detected bright circular rings with a crystalline electron pattern. The characteristics of the indexing planes of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) were noted to indicate the synthesized gold and silver nanoparticles were highly crystalline in nature. From TEM images that characterized the DB synthesized both AuNPs and AgNPs, the shapes of nanoparticles were highly spherical, and only a few irregular shapes were found in the FFT image of the internal spacing of the gold silver plane (1 1 1).
Scimeca et al. (2018)
 reported that HR-TEM images of AuNPs synthesized from plant extract showed highly ordered planar spacing, consistent with the internal spacing of metallic AuNPs. The size and shape of synthesized nanoparticles were measured and the AuNPs had a mean diameter of 15–34 nm with an almost spherical shape with smooth edges (
Mohanta et al., 2017
).

The FESEM micrograph revealed that the synthesized gold and silver nanoparticles were mostly spherical, with a few rod and triangular shapes being noted in both samples (
Fig. 3
a and 3b (i-iii)). The gold and silver nanoparticles had size ranges of 5–25 nm and 10–45 nm, respectively. We also conducted an EDX analysis to confirm the elemental composition of the metal nanoparticles synthesized by the DB extract, as shown in
Fig. 3
a (iv-ix) and
Fig. 3
b (iv-x). The strong elemental signals were observed at 2.3 and 2.8 keV which confirmed the characteristic peak of gold and silver nanocrystalline, as shown in
Fig. 3
a (x) and
Fig. 3
b (xi) respectively. The elemental mapping of the DB-AuNPs and DB-AgNPs samples revealed that the selected area contains the maximum distribution element is gold (23 %) and silver (49 %) respectively (
Fig. 3
a and
Fig. 3
b). Also, some additional elements such as carbon, chloride, copper and oxygen were found in trace amounts in the samples, which presumably originated from the plant extract. Recently, the FESEM images clearly show that the plant extract M. parviflora synthesized AgNPs were mostly spherical. However, some irregular particles were found because of the composition of the synthesis medium and reaction parameters (
Al-Otibi et al., 2021
). The FESEM analysis of nanoparticle showed slightly agglomerated due to the centrifugation at high speed to separate nanoparticles from the colloidal solution. Thus, the organic layer acting as a capping agent was separated from the metal core, leading to particle agglomeration. The EDX analysis of the biosynthesized nanoparticles highlighted the presence of metallic nanoparticles and organic moieties. Also, the biosynthesized Au and Ag exhibited a strong signal of 2.95 and 2.67 keV in the nanoparticle samples and weaker signal of Cl and carbon, which originated from plant sources (
Devi et al., 2016
,
Hussain et al., 2019
).
Mittal et al. (2012)
 found that D. morbifera (DM) extract synthesized metal nanoparticle samples showed a stronger signal of carbon than copper which indicates the impurities from the FESEM carbon grid used for sample preparation. In addition, the faint signals of chromium and oxygen were detected, which may have originated from biomolecules and certain components in the DM leaf extract. Furthermore, the elemental mapping analysis clearly showed the distribution of AuNPs and AgNPs located in the samples with different colors in selected electron micrograph regions.
