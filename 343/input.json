Synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles
Plant extract was prepared by mixing 10 g of Cassia alata fresh leaves with 100 mL of Milli-Q water. The mixture was boiled for 30 min at 60 °C. The mixture was cooled down to room temperature and double filtered using Whatman filter paper no. 1. Filtered mixture was used as the extract and used further for the synthesis of ZnO NP nanoparticles.
0.01 M Zinc acetate was used as precursor and 5 mL of leaf extract was used as a reducing agent. The mixture was stirred on a magnetic plate at 80 °C for 20 min. pH of reaction mixture was adjusted to 12 using 2 M NaOH. The mixture was stirred for 2 h and UV–Visible readings were recorded, wherein a strong peak was observed at the end of 3 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The sedimented pellet was double washed with Milli-Q water and dried overnight in a hot air oven operating at 80 °C. The white colored powder was obtained and used for characterization.

Nanoparticles size obtained using XRD pattern was further validated using SEM micrograph which demonstrated similar results. SEM spectra revealed the spherical shape of nanoparticles with aggregation. EDAX spectra clearly revealed the presence of separate peaks for zinc and oxygen which established the purity of the synthesized nanoparticles (Fig. 3).
Broad peaks observed in the XRD pattern depict enhanced crystallinity as an effect of annealing temperature [20]. The crystallite size of the nanoparticles was determined using the Scherrer equation which was found to be in the range of 60–80 nm (Fig. 2).
