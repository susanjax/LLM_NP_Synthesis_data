Biosynthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles
Microalgal cells were harvested in the middle of the logarithmic phase on the 14th day and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min. The algal supernatant was stored at 4 °C for further use (Suja et al. 2016). Then, 5 ml of 200 mM AgNO3 or 5 ml of 100 mM HAuCl4·3H2O were added slowly to 95 ml of microalgal supernatant with stirring and heating at 50 °C for 30 min using (PMC 509C Multi-Place) Magnetic Stirrer. The resulted concentrations were 10 mM AgNO3 (Maria et al. 2015) and 5 mM HAuCl4·3H2O (El-Sheekh et al. 2020). The control solutions were prepared by adding 5 ml of 200 mM AgNO3 to 95 ml distilled water and 5 ml of 100 mM HAuCl4·3H2O to 95 ml distilled water under the same conditions as experimental solutions. All the experiments were carried out in three replicates.
Characterization of the O.Ag2O|AgO-NPs, and S.Au-NPs
In this method, extracellular nanoparticles formation was observed in all reduction cases, except at Ag-NPs synthesis using Oscillatoria sp. cultivation (in vivo). The Ag-NPs were formed intracellularly, as the blue-green color of Oscillatoria sp. filaments converted to brown (Fig. 1). The intensity of the color increased after 24 h of incubation when S. platensis reduced Au3+ to Au-NPs extracellular with purple or ruby red color (Fig. 2) 
Figure 4 exhibited XRD bands, which revealed the elementary and crystallinity nature of Ag2O|AgO-NPs, and Au-NPs from the cultivation of Oscillatoria sp. and S. platensis, respectively. Sharp peaks from 0o to 80° at 2θ were observed in the XRD pattern, which correlated to the Bragg’s reflections in a face-centered spherical shape O.Ag2O|AgO-NPs with basal 200, 111, 311, and 222. While the XRD of S.Au-NPs showed distinct diffraction peaks at 2θ values corresponded with 111, 200, 220, 311, and 222. The extreme peaks further confirmed triangular-shaped S.Au-NPs. TEM results of O.Ag2O|AgO-NPs which exhibited spherical morphology with a diameter of 10.49–45.81 nm, which were quasi-spherical and well dispersed in nature, while S.Au-NPs demonstrated octahedral, pentagonal, and triangular-shaped nanoparticles free from any aggregation, with average particle size 15.49–55.08 nm (Fig. 5).
