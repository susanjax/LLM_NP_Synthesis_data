Sample group and processing of leaf extract
The leaf extracts were properly cleaned to eliminate dirt and fungal-based spores, and then shade desiccated to eliminate humidity. About 10 g of sample leaves were placed in a 250 mL beaker with 200 mL distilled water and cooked on the heating mantle for 45 min. The extract was then chilled to room temperature (T) before being sieved. This procedure was used to prepare all plant extracts (Tabernaemontana divaricate, Basella alba, and Allium fistulosum).

2.3. Ag NPs synthesis
For AgNPs production, a Ag nitrate solution was equipped. Basella alba, Allium fistulosum, and Tabernaemontana divaricate aqueous solutions are introduced in varying amounts to test tubes containing 2 mM aqueous silver nitrate solution. The studies were performed at different temperatures to find the best conditions for AgNPs production.

The morphological nature of AgNPs are examined by employing SEM. SEM shows solid block-like structures for Basella alba and Allium fistulosum mediated AgNPs while for Tabernaemontana divaricate mediated AgNPs, it shows rod-like structure with some agglomeration where an average particle shape was 40, 55 and 57 nm respectively (
