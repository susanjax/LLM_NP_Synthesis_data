 Stock solutions preparation
Although there are different salts of magnesium like magnesium citrate, glycinate, chloride, malate and sulfate but magnesium nitrate hexahydrate salt (MgNO3)2·6H2O was used as precursor material because it was highly soluble in water (NCBI, 2023). Magnesium oxide nanoparticles were synthesized using different concentrations of magnesium nitrate salt (20 mM, 30 mM, and 40 mM) from 1 M stock solutions following the methodology of Sharma, Sharma, and Sahu (2017). The objective of using different concentrations was to obtain variation in nanoparticles size. The formation of MgO NP’s was confirmed by the color change of the solutions from yellow to yellowish brown (Moorthy, Ashok, Rao, & Viswanathan, 2015). The solutions was shaken for 24 h at 150 rpm on rotary shaker, then dried overnight at 100 °C in an oven to evaporate its water content. After evaporation, the residue was powdered using pestle and mortar. The powdered sample was calcinated at 500 °C for 1 h in muffle furnace to obtain MgO NP’s (Moorthy et al., 2015). These MgO NP’s were used for further analysis.

 The crystal structure and phase identification of MgO NP’s synthesized from different concentrations of salt (20 mM, 30 mM, and 40 mM) were investigated through XRD in the 2θ range from 10 to 90° (Fig. 2). Diffraction peaks at 36.98° (1 1 1), 42.76° (0 0 2), 62.56° (2 0 2), 74.71° (1 1 3) and 78.67° (2 2 2) revealed cubic configuration (a = 4.2 Å) of MgO NPs with space group Fm-3 m confirmed by (JCPDS card no. 01-087-0653). The XRD analysis reveals no additional impurity phases were observed upon increasing the salt concentration from 20 mM to 40 mM. The XRD pattern showed a highly intense (0 0 2) orientation plane, indicating that the synthesized material is highly crystalline. The Debye Scherrer formula (D = 0.89 /βcosθ) was used to calculate the average crystalline size of MgO NP’s synthesized from 20 mM, 30 mM, and 40 mM concentrations of salt. The sizes were as 28.60 nm, 25.46 nm, and 21.78 nm respectively.

 The morphology and structural analysis of MgO NP’s from 20 mM, 30 mM, and 40 mM of salts were investigated using scanning electron micrographs (SEM) (Fig. 3). The resulted images indicated that the nanoparticles with smooth surfaces were virtually spherical. Some of the particles were found to be well dispersed, whereas the majority of them were aggregated (Fig. 3). SEM micrograph studies ensure the attachment of MgO NP’s onto the surface of MgO Nano flakes in sample 40 mM concentrations.
