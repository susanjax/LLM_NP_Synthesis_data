Synthesis of TiO2 Nanoparticles
In a typical experiment, 50 mL of M. citrifolia leaves extract was added to 0.1 M TiCl4 solution. The mixture of solutions was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave at 120 °C for 8 h and then cooled down to room temperature. The resulting white colour suspension was formed and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min, to remove unreacted chemicals. The resultant suspension was filtered and washed several times with DI water and ethanol. The filtered suspension was then dried in an oven at 100 °C for 5 h. The titanium hydroxide was calcinated at 400 °C for 4 h in a muffle furnace. Finally, the quasi-microsphere TiO2 nanoparticles were obtained.
Characterization of TiO2 Nanoparticles
The XRD pattern synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles using the leaves extract of M. citrifolia is depicted in Fig. 2a and b. The eight distinct peaks at 2θ = 27.3°, 36.0°, 41.1°, 43.9°, 54.4°, 56.6°, 62.8°, and 68.9° were understood to be (110), (101), (111), (210), (211), (220), (002), and (301) in lattice planes of the tetragonal phase of TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 2a) and compared with the standard (JCPDS card no: 89-4920) (Fig. 2b). The average crystalline size of TiO2 nanoparticles was calculated using Debye-Scherrer's equation. The average crystalline size (D) obtained using this formula was ± 10 nm.
SEM analysis shows uniformly distributed TiO2 nanoparticles at low- and high magnifications in Fig. 8. The TiO2 nanoparticles were quasi-spherical in shape with particle size range from 10 to 20 nm as shown in the Fig. 8a–d. The SEM images showed that it was composed of nanoparticles without aggregates, well-defined shape and size, which attributed due to the important role of M. citrifolia, leaves extract (act as stabilization/capping agent) with help of hydrothermal process [15]. The particles size decrease inversely proportion to increase the surface to volume ratio that helps to easily penetrate the cell wall and killed microorganisms rapidly, which are the main reasons of the enhancement of antimicrobial activities of green synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles [7].
