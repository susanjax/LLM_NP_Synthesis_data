 Synthesis of silver nanoparticles
To synthesize silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in an environmentally friendly manner, the Swertia chirata plant extracts were introduced into a solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3) and stirred continuously while maintaining an ambient temperature of 15 °C–25 °C [27]. The synthesis of AgNPs was observed at different intervals of time, with varying concentrations of both silver nitrate (AgNO3) and plant extracts being used in the process (Fig. 3).
