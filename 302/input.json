CuNPs synthesis using C. guianensis extract
For the synthesis of CuNPs, 0.25 g of copper sulfate [CuSO4] was dissolved in 50 ml of distilled water; 4 ml of each C. guianensis extract was added dropwise and stirred for 10 min using a magnetic stirrer until a deep green colour formed. The reaction mixture was further stirred at 60 °C for 1–2 h. The resulting reaction mixture was kept at room temperature (12–14 h) and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting precipitates were rinsed with deionized water, followed by washing with absolute ethanol (2–3 times) to remove residual impurities, then the precipitates were dried in an oven about 70 °C for 10 h.

The formation of CuNPs is confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD pattern of CuNPs powder is shown in (
Fig. 2
). All diffraction peaks are well indexed on the face-centered cubic area. The (FFC) crystalline structural phases of copper that works well with the JCPDS card No. 89-2838. All peak positions agree with metallic copper. The sharp peaks of the XRD pattern indicate the crystalline nature of the product (

SEM images (
Fig. 6
) showed that the synthesized CuNPs were clustered, and the surfaces of the aggregates were irregular. As observed, the images showed that the particles were present in both mono-disperse and agglomerated forms with approximately spherical morphologies. Such a variation in particle size and shape distribution could be explained by the chemical structures of the various components contained in the plant extracts (
