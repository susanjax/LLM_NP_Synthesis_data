Synthesis of silver nanoparticles
A reaction mixture contained 220 ml of dragon fruit extract in 110 ml of 10 mM silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution.
The solution was stirred for 24 h on a magnetic stirrer at room temperature. Silver nanopaticles were separated from
the reaction mixture by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 ºC. The pellet was redispersed in deionized
water and centrifuged again at the same condition as mentioned above to gain the purity of nanosilver. Later,
lyophilization was performed to obtain silver nanoparticle powder. The effect of pH was studied by adjusting the pH
of DPE to 3.35, 4.35 and 5.35 prior to reacting with AgNO3.
The morphology and size of the synthesized silver nanoparticles prepared at different pH values were analyzed
by TEM as shown in Fig. 2. All prepared silver nanoparticles were spherical in shape and polydisperse. An
aggregation of the biogenic silver nanoparticle was obviously monitored when the biogenic silver nanoparticle
prepared under lower pH: 3.35 and 4.35. The average diameter of the particle prepared at pH 3.35, 4.35 and 5.35
were 26.2±8.2, 25.7±8.7 and 25.3±7.9 nm, respectively. This result corresponds to hypsochromic shift of the
absorption bands in the UV-Visible spectra in Fig. 1. In addtion, silver nanoparticles were surrounded by a thin layer
which could be an organic constituent in the fruit peel extract.
The XRD pettern of the silver nanoparticles compared with DPE is depicted in Fig. 3. The XRD peaks at 2T of
38.1 and 77.4 correspond to (111) and (311) crystalline planes of the face-centered cubic structure of metallic silver.
However, a few additional and yet unassigned peaks were also noticed in the XRD pattern of silver. This
unindentified peak was apparently not originated from organic compounds found in DPE because no peak was
observed in the XRD spectrum of DPE. In addition, the most intense peak at 32.5 possibly indicated a presence of
Ag2O in the synthesized silver nanoparticles.
