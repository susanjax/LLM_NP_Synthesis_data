Synthesis of silver nanoparticles
1 mM aqueous solution of silver nitrate was prepared and used for the production of AgNPs. 10 ml of C. fistula extract was added in 90 ml of aqueous solution of 1 mM silver nitrate and incubated overnight at room temperature in darkness [19].
Characterization of silver nanoparticles
 The biosynthesis of AgNPs was confirmed by UV–Vis spectrophotometry analysis. The examination displayed an absorbance peak of approximately 418 nm (figure 1), which was known for AgNPs. Bragg peaks resulting from the XRD study demonstrated the centered cubic structure of AgNPs. Intense peaks were detected at 38.20°, 44.29°, 64.48°, and 77.39°. The expanding of the Bragg peaks showed the production of AgNPs. The results were analyzed via X'Pert Highscore plus software and confirmed. The results are showed in figure 2.
TEM analysis demonstrated the production of AgNPs, as displayed in figure 3. The AgNPs were triangular, hexahedral and amorphous in form and their typical sizes were about 50–150 nm. Other studies showed different results of TEM method. The DLS templates (figure 4) showed that synthesized AgNPs have a Zeta average diameter of 31.16 nm with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.605.
