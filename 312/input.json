Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles
To make green AgNPs, 5 mL of C. sebestena aqueous leaf extract was mixed with 95 mL of 1 mM aqueous silver nitrate solution. The pH was adjusted to 9.5 by adding 1 M NaOH solution in drops. This solution was stirred continuously for 24 h. This solution was kept in the dark to avoid photoactivated adverse effects. The change in solution color from red to dark brown indicated the production of AgNPs. The dark brown solution was centrifuged at a speed of 10,000 rpm. The residue was recovered as black pellets. Silver nanoparticles were formed after washing with double distilled water and designated as Cs-AgNPs, which were subsequently kept at 4 °C until further usage

.
The formation of the nanocrystalline Cs-AgNPs was further confirmed by using the XRD analysis.

. The peaks of the (111), (220), and (311) planes were also observed in the biosynthesized AgNPs using Convolvulus arvensisextract [

]. In addition, the peak of (110) was reported AgNPs synthesized from Excoecaria agallocha
[46]
. The presence of various reducing agents in the extract is responsible for the stabilization of AgNPs and, thus, for providing the crystalline structure of AgNPs, which was well studied in various biosynthesized nanoparticles [

]. The Braggs reflections based on strong peaks observed at 2
=38.36° and 44.8° reveals that there is formation of face centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure of Cs-AgNPs
[39]
. The Cs-AgNPs are well crystalline and the position and the relative intensity of the diffraction peaks from XRD pattern match well with the standard phase Cs-AgNPs diffraction pattern of the International Center of Diffraction Data card (JCPDS-80–1916). The average particle sizes of the synthesized Cs-AgNPs nanoparticles were calculated using Debye-Scherrer formula (Eq. 1). D = K λ/β cosθ. Where, D is the mean diameter of nanoparticles, β is the full width at half-maximum value of XRD diffraction lines, λ is the wavelength of X-ray radiation source 0.15405 nm, θ is the half diffraction angle–Bragg angle and K is the Scherrer constant with value from 0.9 to 1.
The average crystalline size of green synthesized Cs-AgNPs nanoparticles using C. sebestena Leaf extract calculated from Scherrer equation it was about 34 nm. The XRD pattern thus shows that the Cs-AgNPs were formed by the reduction of Ag+ ions by C. sebestena Leaf extract exudates are crystalline in nature.
The scanning electron microscope was used to examine the surface morphology and size of the AgNPs. Individual AgNPs as well as numerous aggregates were seen in the SEM picture (

a, b) and the EDS (

It shows that the majority of the particles are spherical in shape and aggregate into larger particles without having a clear morphology. The AgNPs range in size from 20 to 50 nm, according to the SEM image and particle size histogram. The secondary metabolites that may be present in the C. sebestena leaf extracts have helped this aggregation
[33]
. The type of extract used have significant role to play in the size and shape of the nanoparticles formed. Some examples are compared in the
