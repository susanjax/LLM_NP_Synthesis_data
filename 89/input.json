Synthesis and Characterization of SNPs. SNPs were synthesized using a modified Stöber method.1 Typically, 8 mL of Igepal CO-520 was dissolved in 35 mL cyclohexane, followed by the addition of 0.3 mL of water containing 0.2 mL of 28.8% ammonium hydroxide with vigorous stirring. After addition of 0.2 mL of TEOS the emulsion was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. For the synthesis of FAM-conjugated SNPs, 50 mg of FAM in 10 mL DMF mixed with APTS at a 1:3 molar ratio was used in place of TEOS. The resulting SNPs were collected by centrifugation followed by washing and freeze-drying for 48 h. 
Characterization of SNPs
Figure 1 shows TEM and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of SNPs with diameters of 21.06 ± 3.38 (20), 40.26 ± 3.14 (40), 59.72 ± 4.58 (60), 81.05 ± 4.99 (80), 100.33 ± 4.78 (100), 149.87 ± 5.70 (150) and 199.89 ± 6.57 (200) nm, indicating that the particles are spherical and well-defined in size. The 20, 60, 100, and 200 nm SNPs were subjected to dynamic light scattering (DLS) to measure hydrodynamic sizes, which were 37.82 ± 6.17, 70.12 ± 17.5, 105.5 ± 38.58 and 203.3 ± 50.75 nm in DI water, respectively. The sizes measured by the two different methods indicate that the smaller SNPs, 20 and 60 nm, aggregate significantly in DI water. Corresponding zeta potentials were measured to be − 24.5 ± 3.74, − 38.1 ± 9.85, − 31.7 ± 8.73 and − 36.3 ± 8.08, respectively, indicating good overall particle stability. DLS measurements were also attempted in culture media, but found to be unreliable due to protein aggregates.24 Finally, the external surface areas of the 20, 60, 100, and 200 nm SNPs were calculated to be 88.905, 49.724, 29.289, and 13.762 m2/g, respectively, by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method.
