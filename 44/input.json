Synthesis of Au NPs
The Olea europaea (OE) fruit extract and Acacia nilotica (AN) husk extract (OEAN) aqueous extract was centrifuged for 15 min at 7000 rpm at room temperature, and the resulting pure solution was used for the preparation of NPs. The chloroauric acid was dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water by stirring at 1000 rpm at 40 °C for 15 min. This was followed by the addition of 5 mL of the OEAN extract to the light-yellow aqueous solution of 1 mmol/mL HAuCl4. A color change to red indicated the reduction of AuCl4− ions to Au particles, as well as the formation of Au NPs.

Characterization of green-synthesized NPs
The UV–vis absorption spectrum of the aqueous solution of Au NPs prepared from the OEAN extract, shown in Fig. 1(A), indicates a surface plasmon absorption band at 617.99 nm. This can be attributed to the oscillation of free conduction electrons induced by the absorption of electromagnetic radiation [9] by Au NPs. The synthesized Au NPs had an average size of 44.96 nm, which was also clearly supported by the appearance of a single 100%-intensity peak with a width of 76.47 nm.
Fig. 2B shows the SEM image of the synthesized Au NPs, demonstrating that most of the NPs are spherical, with dispersed irregular forms and some aggregation. While. Fig. 2C. shows the EDS spectra of the Au NPs synthesized using the OEAN extract, which confirms the presence of Au in the suspension [4], [12].
