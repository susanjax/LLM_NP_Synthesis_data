AgNPs synthesis
Fig. 1
 depicts a graphic representation of AgNPs production. To produce AgNPs from an aqueous extract of I. carnea leaves, silver nitrate (AgNO3) purchase from sigma aldrich was used as a precursor. 90 ​mL of 1 ​mM AgNO3 was prepared in double-distilled water, and 10 ​mL of 10% (w/v) aqueous leaves extract was added drop by drop with continuous stirring. The color of this colloidal solution changed from clear to a golden brown, signifying the formation of AgNPs. This colloidal solution was kept for 24 ​h in a dark environment. After 24 ​h, the supernatant was removed, and the remaining fraction was centrifuged at 10000 RPM for 20 ​min. After centrifugation, the top portion was removed, and the settling particles were washed with double distilled water at 10000 RPM for 5 ​min before the supernatant was discarded. Repeat the washing cycle at the same RPM and time. Following the second wash step, settling particles were purified with ethanol at 10000 RPM for 5 ​min. After purification, the supernatant was discarded and recovered AgNPs were oven-dried for 24 ​h at 55 ​°C [

Braggs's reflections were shown at 37.77, 44.28, 63.01, and 77.12 for the leaves extract synthesized AgNPs which confirm the presence of 111, 200, 220, and 311 lattice planes (
Fig. 4
). Based on lattice plane sets these metal particles were categorized as FCC (face center cubic) crystals. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the highest intense peak was 0.78256 and the average particle size was 11.21 ​nm. Approximately similar results were observed by Ghozali et al. [
25
] and Shehabeldine et al. [
27
].
The images of FE-SEM clearly showed that fabricated nanoparticles were well distributed and spherical shaped with less aggregation (
Fig. 5
). The average size of nanoparticles was 46.90 ​nm which is observed in the distributed histogram (
Fig. 6
). The EDX analysis showed a high-intensity peak of Ag metal which was about 92.15% w/w (
Fig. 7
). These results are corroborating the findings of Vorobyova et al. [
28
] who green synthesized AgNPs by grape pomace.
