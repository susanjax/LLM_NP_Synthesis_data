Synthesis of AgNPs incorporated with extracts
The extract was prepared in order to synthesize AgNPs, following the procedure described in
[28]
,
[29]
. A total of 80 mL of a 5 mM aqueous solution of AgNO3 was added to 20 mL of C. gileadensis extract that was prepared using ultrasonic-microwave (Cg-US/MICE). The resulting mixture was continuously stirred at 60 °C for 6 h until the solution changed from light brown to dark brown. Then, Cg-AgNPs dispersion was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 ℃ to eliminate the residual solution and obtain the precipitated nanoparticles. After Cg-AgNPs were obtain, they were washed with deionized water and centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 min three times. Finally, the produced Cg-AgNPs were freeze-dried and kept at 4 °C until they were characterized using TEM.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the AgNPs is depicted in
Fig. 3
. The peaks were indexed, and Miller indices were used to identify the crystalline phases present. The observed reflections corresponded to AgNPs with face-centered cubic symmetry

[47]
. The high-intensity peaks indicated that the AgNPs were highly crystalline
[48]
. The diffractogram showed peaks at 23.46°, 27.81°, 38.36°, 44.56°, 46.53°, 55.10°, and 57.60°. These peaks corresponded to face-centered cubic metallic silver (JCPDS 76–1393)
[49]
. This confirms that the main component of the nanoparticles was Ag metal.

The average diameters of the AgNPs were found to be 92 ± 10.2 nm (with PDI = 0.35 ± 0.02).

TEM analysis of the reaction solution was conducted to investigate the impact of synthesis conditions on the size, shape, size distribution, and crystalline structure of AgNPs. Analysis of a biosynthetic reaction under a microscope confirmed the synthesis of AgNPs. The TEM images of biosynthesized nanoparticles are shown as examples in
Fig. 7
. As shown in the micrograph, agNPs are typically characterized by their distinctive characteristics, exhibiting nearly spherical shapes and minimal or no particle aggregation. The findings revealed that the synthesized Cg-AgNP exhibited a spherical shape, with nanoparticle diameters ranging from 7.7 to 42.9 nm (
