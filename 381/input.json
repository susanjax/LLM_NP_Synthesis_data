Biofabrication of nanoparticles (NPs)
With slight modifications, the aqueous seed extract of A. garckeana was used to synthesize silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by adopting previously described methods [18], [33]. Approximately 10 ml of the extract was mixed with 90 ml of a 1 mM silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution to reduce the amount of silver ions. The reaction was carried out under static conditions at 30 ± 2 ºC for 2 h (Fig. 1). The resulting solution was observed visually as a change in the colour and through absorbance measurements of the reaction mixture using a UV–visible spectrophotometer.

The SEM micrograph revealed an AgNPs morphology of clustered crystalline pattern as could be seen in Fig. 5b. Also, EDXRF analysis revealed the qualitative and quantitative elemental composition of the AgNPs. The high level of Ag as the most abundant element in the synthesized AgNPs (95%) as revealed by the EDX spectrum implies the reduction of Ag2+ to Ag0 with a high level of purity as depicted in Fig. 5c.
