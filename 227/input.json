Preparation of salt solution and green synthesis of iron nanoparticles
To create the iron salt solution, FeCl3.6 H2O was utilized. The salt was mixed with a specified volume of distilled water to achieve a solution with a concentration of 3 mM
[16]
. The nanoparticles were fabricated through the blending of plant extract with a 3 mM aqueous solution of ferric chloride, at 1:2 ratio. The reaction mixture was subjected to a controlled temperature of 70°C on a hot plate stirred for 1 h. Upon completion of the incubation period, the solution containing the FeNPs underwent centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min (after cooling). The resultant pellet was subsequently subjected to sonication for 4 min at a frequency of 50 Hz. The nanoparticles were subjected to drying at 70°C for 1–2 h, resulting in the formation of powdered nanoparticles, which were then collected and made ready for subsequent characterization.

SEM analysis was conducted to characterize the size, aggregation, morphological shapes, and distribution of the synthesized NPs.
Fig. 5
 presents the SEM images showcasing the FeNPs produced from P. plebeium and C. sinensis. These images indicate an anisotropic nano-scale structure, leaning towards a spherical or hexagonal configuration. The FeNPs were observed in both dispersed and agglomerated forms. This agglomeration can be ascribed to the presence of biological compounds on the particle surfaces. The average size or diameter of the FeNPs fell within the range of 50–200 nm. As seen in
Fig. 5
(a & b), P. plebeium exhibited sizes of approximately 155 nm and 151 nm, while in
Fig. 5
(c & d) C. sinensis displayed sizes of around 57 nm, 59 nm, and 97 nm. Studies have shown that silver nanoparticles obtained from the extract of Diospyros lotus leaves exhibited a spherical-like morphology and fell within the nano-size range
