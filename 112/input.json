Synthesis of Ag/AgCl-NPs using OLE
To the best of our knowledge, this plant has not been investigated before. Preliminary results of the reducing capacity of OE promoted us to investigate the potential of the plant. Several trials have been conducted to optimize the conditions for the synthesis. Five mg of silver nitrate was incubated in 30 ml of the OLE to achieve a 1 mM solution. The mixture was heated to 65 °C for 20 min with constant stirring [34]. Then the mixture was incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 90 min. To collect the biosynthesized nanoparticles (Ag/AgCl-NPs), the mixture was centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 30 min and then washed three times with distilled water under the same conditions. Ag/AgCl-NPs were dried at 40 °C for 24 h and stored in the dark at 4 °C for later use.

Characterization of OLE-based Ag/AgCl-NPs
Ag/AgCl-NPs’ crystallinity and phase microstructure were assessed using XRD with a 2θ of 20–80° scanning range, as depicted in Fig. 2. The four peaks that aroused with 2θ values at 38.09°, 44.25°, 64.47°, and 77.53° corresponded to reflections of the crystallographic planes (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes, respectively (ref. code: 00-004-0783) [22,51].They are indicative of the presence of metallic silver nanoparticles. The eight peaks that emerged at 27.69°, 32.15°, 46.13°, 54.83°, 57.41°, 67.39°, 74.42°, and 76.68° corresponded to (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331) and (420) planes, due to the presence of silver chloride phase (ref. code: 00-006-0480) [52]. XRD results are indicative of the face-centered-cubic (fcc) metallic AgNPs and fcc AgCl-NPs. AgCl phase comprised 59% and Ag phase 40 %. These data are in line with the literature, in which the constituents of the walnut green husk extract in one study and those of Cissus quadrangularis Linn leaf extract were regarded as the sources of chloride in the synthesis of AgCl-NPs [53,54]. The lattice parameter and crystallite size of the nanoparticles were extracted from the MAUD analysis and was found to be 4.086 
Å
 and 12.9 nm. Previous studies showed AgNPs with an average crystallite size of 7 nm that were biologically synthesized using Moringa oleifera leaf extract [55], whereas those synthesized by spray-pyrolysis were 39.4 nm in size [51].
TEM analysis was used to evaluate the size and surface morphology of Ag/AgCl-NPs. Ag/AgCl-NPs appeared to be pseudo-spherical based on the TEM image, shown in Fig. 3a. The resulting histogram, which represents the size distributions of the particles, was obtained using Image J software of at least 100 particles (Fig. 3b) and fitted according to the lognormal function. By referring to the result in Fig. 3b, the particle size was determined to vary between 1 and 40 nm, with an average particle size of 13.5 nm which was supported by the crystallite size calculated from the XRD pattern, i.e. 12 nm.
