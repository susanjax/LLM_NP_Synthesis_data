Synthesis of iron-oxide (magnetite) NPs
In a 500-mL three-neck flask with a condenser, 16.20 g of the iron oleate complex produced above was combined with 2.57 g of oleic acid. 30 mL of either paraffin wax or docosane was added to the flask as a solvent, along with 5–10 boiling stones, since a characteristic nucleation event occurs at 200 °C and may cause the pressure to increase significantly. Under argon flow, the mixture was heated to 370 °C at a rate of 5 °C per minute and held at that temperature for 15 min. After synthesis, the mixture was cooled to 50 °C, and NPs were washed three times with 95%-hexanes and acetone, and redispersed in chloroform. The iron-oxide NPs used in this study have a very narrow size distribution and the procedure produces consistent 16–17 ± 2 nm NPs per batch. The same batch of iron-oxide NPs characterized here was used as a precursor for the zero-valent iron NPs and iron nitride NPs, as well as in the biological studies.

Synthesis of zero-valent iron NPs
The NPs were synthesized in docosane in the same 500-mL three-neck flask using the same method as above. However, the reactants were reduced with a molar equivalent of sodium borohydride (NaBH4), as reported in the literature [147,148,149,150,151]. The reaction was carried out at 250 °C and kept at that temperature for 2 h. The NPs were separated from the docosane by diluting with a nonpolar solvent (95%-hexanes) and using a permanent magnet for magnetic separation under air-free conditions (in an atmosphere-controlled glove box), Subsequently, the NPs were annealed under air-free conditions to remove any remaining organics prior to being capped with alginate as described below.
Characterization of NPs
TEM results (Fig. 5) show a spherical morphology, high monodispersity, and the iron cores measure approximately 16 nm in diameter, in agreement with the DLS results taken for NPs coated with oleate. Figure 6 shows a TEM image of an iron nitride NP, showing an oblong, rounded-rectangular morphology. The iron nitride NPs were approximately 15-45 nm × 30-65 nm in size. 
The XRD data for iron-oxide NPs (Fig. 8) suggest that the composition of the NPs is 70–80% spinel-phase iron oxide, which we attribute to magnetite. The remaining 20–30% appears to be FeO (wüstite) and α-Fe2O3 (hematite), likely the result of surface oxidation of the alpha iron. 
XRD spectrum for the uncapped iron nitride NP sample can be seen in Fig. 9. The Jade software automatched the spectrum to the iron nitride (martensite) phases α’-Fe8N, ICDD/ICSD card number 01-070-6150 and α’’-Fe16N2, ICDD/ICSD card number 01-078-1865, both tetragonal crystals with lattice constants a = 5.71 Å, b = 5.71 Å, c = 6.016 Å and a = 5.72 Å, b = 5.72 Å, c = 6.29 Å, respectively. The scan also reveals some magnetite (Fe + 2Fe2 + 3O4), ICDD/ICSD card number 00-019-0629, which is a cubic crystal with lattice constants a = 8.38 Å, b = 8.38 Å, c = 8.38 Å.
DLS results on OA-capped NPs right after synthesis returned an average diameter of ~ 16 nm (Fig. 10), in agreement with the TEM observations. PEG-5000 has a theoretical average length of ~ 30 nm, however it is important to note that the polymer length is just an average value, in addition the polymer chain can bend and twist resulting in a range of measured values.
