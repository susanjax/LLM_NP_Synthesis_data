Synthesis of Ag@GO
Preparation of GO was performed by the improved Hummers' method [17]. Scheme 1 describes the in situ method applied for synthesizing the Ag@GO material [18]. Accordingly, AgNO3/NH4OH solution (5 mg/mL) was added to GO under ultrasonication for 10 min. Then, glucose (10 mg/mL) was mixed into the solution under stirring at 60 °C for an hour. The obtained mixture was cooled down to room temperature, centrifuged, and washed with distilled water and ethanol, respectively. After being dried, Ag@GO powder was ultimately obtained.

The materials with AgNO3:GO ratios of 1:4, 2:4, 3:4, 4:4, and 5:4 were denoted Ag@GO-1, Ag@GO-2, Ag@GO-3, Ag@GO-4, and Ag@GO-5, respectively. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analyses of these materials were carried to provide a better understanding of the effect of AgNO3 dose on the formation of AgNPs on GO sheets. As shown in Fig. 2, the average diameter of the anchored AgNPs was between 10 and 25 nm. With the increase in the ratio of AgNO3, the films seem to be more transparent, suggesting the exfoliation of GO sheets which subsequently promotes the anchoring of AgNPs. The increase in density of AgNPs could be attributed to the increase in the dose of AgNO3, while the agglomeration of AgNPs is suppressed by their anchoring onto GO sheets. As GO is claimed to be an effective stabilizer for the formation of metal NPs, the antibacterial activity of Ag@GO could be enhanced. The obtained results are in good accordance with UV–Vis results.
As shown in Fig. 4b, a distinctive peak of GO at around 2θ = 10.1° indicated that the GO synthesized from graphite was of high purity [28]. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Ag@GO introduces diffraction peaks at 2θ = 78.4, 65.2, 44.5, and 38.7° assigned to the (311), (220), (200), and (111) crystallographic planes of AgNPs, respectively, confirming the successful decoration of AgNPs onto GO laminates [29]. The results were in good accordance with XRD data (JCPDS No. 04–0783) for the face-centered cubic structural Ag metal. In some studies, the introduction of AgNPs onto GO laminates increased the interlaying spacing between GO sheets, which is correlated with the exfoliation of GO [27].
Morphologies of GO and Ag@GO-4 were investigated via SEM and TEM images, as shown in Fig. 5. The flat surface of GO with numerous folds was observed in Fig. 5a; meanwhile, Fig. 5b demonstrates the decrease in the folding of GO as AgNPs were anchored onto GO laminates. The decrease in folds suggested that the interlayer spacing between GO laminates has increased [31]. The uniform distribution of AgNPs with an average grain size of 16.66 ± 3.73 nm was further confirmed in Fig. 5c and d, corroborating with previous data and supporting the antibacterial properties of the nanocomposite.
