Synthesis of copper nanoparticles
In the synthesis of copper nanoparticles an aqueous solution (0.001 M) of copper nitrate (CuNO3)2 was used and Garcinia mangosteen leaf extract of 5 ml was added to 95 ml of copper nitrate solution in Erlenmeyer flask. It was heated on water bath at 70 °C for 1 h. It was observed that the colour changes from dark brown to light green indicating the reduction of copper nitrate to copper ions. Thus the copper nanoparticles were obtained. Therefore, the reduction process of metal ions with the formation of nanoparticles is affected by a large number of factors; besides the nature of a plant extract containing active biomolecules in different combinations and concentrations (the effects of which are described above), these include the reaction mixture pH, incubation temperature, reaction time, concentration, and electrochemical potential of a metal ion

. Due to the limited ability of plants to reduce metal ions, the efficiency of metal nanoparticle synthesis also depends on the electrochemical potential of an ion
[35]
. Thus, the ability of a plant extract to effectively reduce metal ions may be significantly higher in the case of ions having a large positive electrochemical potential (for example, Ag+) than in the case of ions with a low electrochemical potential such as ([Ag(S2O3)2]3−)
[19]
. As discussed above, the proteins that are present in a plant extract may significantly affect the formation of nanoparticles. The approaches that have recently been used for the “green” synthesis of metal nanoparticles combine the use of plant extracts with the exogenous supplementation of the in vitro reactions with biomatrices: peptides, and proteins, whose amino acid sequence and structure are optimized for the efficient production of nanoparticles.


Copper nanoparticles are characterized using XRD. The XRD pattern of copper nanoparticles is shown in
Fig. 1
 where three distinct peaks are observed at 2θ values 43.37°, 50.50° and 74.21° corresponding to (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) Miller indices
[20]
. It was observed that diffraction peaks correspond to JCPDS No: 04-0836 and reveal that particles were Face Centred Cubic (FCC) in structure
[21]
. The Cu powder was observed to be well crystallized due to the sharpness in the major peak (1 1 1). From
Fig. 1
 we observe that the plane (1 1 1) modifies marginally towards the higher diffraction angle (2θ) by a value of 0.09 when compared with bulk value (2θ = 43.295; JCPDS 04-0836) showing compressive stress. The plane spacing ‘d’ was calculated using Bragg’s equation. The lattice constant ‘a’ for FCC was calculated form the equation

SEM
Examination of SEM micrographs revealed the shape and size.
Fig. 7
 shows the SEM image of copper nanoparticles. The morphology of copper nanoparticles was spherical and agglomerated.
