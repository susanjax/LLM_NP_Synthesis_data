 Biosynthesis of AgNPs
 The process of biosynthesis of AgNPs was performed according to previous studies with some modifications [22] , [23] . In short, the ethanolic extract was prepared by macerating 1 gm fresh Syzygium aromaticum (Clove flower buds) in 100 ml of absolute ethanol (Sigma Aldrich, USA) for 24 hr. at room temperature. Then, 1 ml of clove extract was added to 100 ml of 1 mM analytical grade silver nitrate (Techno Pharmachem, India) and stirred at 300 rpm for 2 hr. at different temperatures (25, 55, 85, and 130 Â°C) for optimum Sa-AgNPs formulation. Before the blood hemolysis and cytotoxicity assays, the prepared Sa-AgNPs were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 30 min, then the nanoparticles were collected and washed three times to ensure the removal of the AgNO3 and clove residues. Then the suspended Sa-AgNPs were dried, balanced, and stored for further experiments. The formation of the nanoparticle was confirmed by a color change from colorless to bright brown. The formation of the nanoparticle was confirmed by a color change from colorless to bright brown.

  TEM micrographs display the binding of Sa-AgNPs to the head of phage ZCSE6 The morphological characterization of the biosynthesized Sa-AgNPs and their combination with phage nanoparticles was visualized using TEM microscopy. In Fig. 3 .a and .b, Sa-AgNPs appeared in a spherical shape with a range of sizes from 5 to 11 nm in diameter. On the other hand, when Sa-AgNPs were combined with phage particles, TEM micrographs showed that Sa-AgNPs were attached to the capsid of the phage ( Fig. 3 .c and .d). The attachment of AgNPs to phage capsid was previously reported without forming aggregations upon combination with different phages [36] . Moreover, Abdelsattar et al. reported the attachment of AgNPs to the phage capsid along with other phage compartments such as the tail and neck [23] .
