Preparation of resveratrol nanoparticles (RNs)
According to our previous study, RNs were synthesized 
[10]
. Briefly, resveratrol (99%) obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany) was dissolved in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to create a stock solution. The resveratrol solution was added dropwise to phosphate-buffered saline while continuously stirring at room temperature or lower, to prevent nanoparticle aggregation. The mixture was then sonicated at 0.6 W for 10 minutes to break up any large aggregates and create a uniform size distribution. To obtain nanoparticles, the suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes to remove any residual solvent. The resulting nanoparticles were then washed with deionized water and dried under a vacuum to obtain a powder. The morphology of RNPs was confirmed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM; Zeiss EM10C).
Confirmation of synthesized RNs
The morphology of NRs includes a spherical shape with an average particle size of around 100 nm, as illustrated in
