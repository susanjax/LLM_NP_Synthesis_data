Preparation of Ni-TiO2 photocatalyst
The Ni-TiO2 photocatalysts were prepared with the modified sol–gel method, which was reported previously [9]. In the preparation, titanium (IV) isopropoxide was mixed with glacial acetic acid and magnetically stirred for 5 min, and then aqueous solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate was added and again stirred for 1 h. To get the desired concentration of Ni2+ ion as a dopant (1.0–3.0 mol%) in TiO2, required stoichometric amount of aqueous solution of NiSO4(H2O)6 was then added to the mixture and stirred vigorously for 2 h. The pH of the resulting solution was adjusted to 10 by adding ammonia. The solution was further stirred at 60 °C for 3 h and then filtered. The catalyst was washed with 50 mL of ethanol. After drying at 110 °C in oven, the catalyst was calcinated in air at 500 °C for 5 h. The color of these Ni-TiO2 nanoparticles is yellowish. The various samples such as 1.0 mol% Ni-doped TiO2, 2.0 mol% Ni-doped TiO2, and 3.0 mol% Ni-doped TiO2 are denoted as Ni1-TiO2, Ni2-TiO2 and Ni3-TiO2, respectively.
Characterization of Ni-TiO2
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of undoped TiO2 and Ni-TiO2 nanoparticles. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.07, 37.59, 47.98, 53.72, 54.86, 62.58, 68.54, 70.05, 75.05, and 82.65 corresponds to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), (215), and (224), respectively for plane of tetragonal anatase TiO2 (JCPDS 21-1272). There were no peaks corresponding to rutile phase or oxide of the dopant metal ions. The crystallite size was calculated using Debye–Scherrer formula:

where D is the crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation (CuKa = 0.15418 nm), θ is the diffraction angle and β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM). The calculated crystallite sizes are 11.47 nm, 9.67 nm, 8.59 nm, and 7.96 nm for 0.0 mol%, 1.0 mol%, 2.0 mol% and 3.0 mol% doping of Ni2+ in TiO2, respectively.
TEM image of the Ni3-TiO2 nanoparticles and the corresponding SAED pattern are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. It is evident from TEM micrograph that the synthesized Ni-TiO2 nanoparticles have uneven and non-spherical particles. The particle size obtained from TEM micrograph is within the range of 8–10 nm. This is in close agreement with the average crystallite size obtained from XRD analysis
