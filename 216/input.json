Synthesis of Ag@MnOx/m-SiO2 nanospherical composite
The assembly of the hierarchically structured Ag@MnOx/m-SiO2 (AMSs) nanocomposite was depicted as follows. DDA (0.01 mol) was added to a mixed solution composed of deionized water (62 mL) and ethanol (25 mL), and the resulting solution was kept with additional stirring for 0.5 h. 0.003 mol of Mn precursor was added to the DDA micelle solution. Then, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mmol AgNO3 solutions were poured, respectively, and the resulting solutions became translucence. TEOS (10.7 mL) was injected into the above mixture with strong stirring and stirred for another 4 h. The mixture was aged for 18 h at 45 °C and reached by centrifugation and washing. Finally, the collected and dried samples were calcined for 6 h at 550 °C in the air and labeled as AMSs-1, AMSs-2, and AMSs-3, respectively. Mn-functionalized mesoporous silica was prepared using the same procedure as above without adding any Ag precursor, and the product was labeled as MSs. Ag-functionalized mesoporous silica was prepared through the same procedure as above without adding any Mn precursor, and the resulting samples were labeled ASs-1 ASs-2, and ASs-3, respectively. Furthermore, the corresponding uncalcined samples were named ASs-1-w, ASs-2-w, and ASs-3-w, respectively.

The morphology configuration of the synthesized AMSs and the microscale states of Ag and Mn in the silica were determined by TEM technology.

(a–f) shows the TEM images of AMSs-1, AMSs-2, and AMSs-3 indicating their nano-spherical morphology, basically maintaining a nanometer size of about 100 nm. Specifically, AMSs-1 and AMSs-2 afford uniform nano-sperical configuration with a smooth spherical surface, while the visible ultrasmall metal cores of about 8.0 nm were encapsulated into the mesoporous nanosphere, which validated the predesigned core@shell hybrid configuration. Interestingly,

f shows a spherical morphology bonded together to a certain extent with more distributed Ag nanoparticles on the spherical surface of AMSs-3, which may be due to a higher Ag loading during the assembly affecting the formation of the nanosphere. The HRTEM image of the AMSs-3 in
