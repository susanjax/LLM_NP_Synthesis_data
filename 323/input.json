Synthesis of pure and Mg-doped ZnO nanostructures
The synthesis commenced by sequentially dissolving Solutions A and B. Upon dissolution, the substances were subsequently merged for a duration of forty minutes under standard environmental conditions. The nuanced approach described herein assumes a critical function in the orchestration of both the nucleation and subsequent growth processes of ZnO nanoparticles. The initial phases of the process play a crucial role in determining the ultimate size, shape, and crystal structure of the nanoparticle.
Following this, the combined solution underwent a laser-assisted synthesis phase. Here, the liquid was exposed to a 532 nm wavelength semiconductor green laser operating at 6 W. While undergoing laser exposure, the solution also endured magnetic stirring, all the while maintaining a consistent temperature of 65 °C. This continued for three hours, a duration chosen based on the laser's ability to instigate photochemical reactions, ensuring the emergence of uniform ZnO nanostructures. Once synthesized, a purification regimen was employed. The nanostructures were filtered, subjected to an ethanol wash, air-dried at a temperature of 115 °C for an hour, and subsequently annealed at 450 °C for a further 3 h. This comprehensive purification ensures the eradication of residual organic matter. The Mg-doped ZnO followed a similar synthesis trajectory. The key distinguishing feature was the utilization of the amalgamated solution of A, B, and C. The laser-assisted synthesis procedure mirrored that of the pure ZnO, ensuring consistency. Visual representation of the methodology are presented in Fig. 1.
Fig. 3 showcases the XRD patterns of pure ZnO and its magnesium-doped (1 %, 1.5 %, and 3 %) counterparts, bringing to light their structural distinctions. For both pure and magnesium-doped samples, the observed peaks align with specific crystal planes, matching the criteria laid out in the JCPDS card no. 89–0510 [37]. these peaks embody the hexagonal wurtzite structure for ZnO within the P63mc space group. Recognized for its expansive surface area and high surface-to-volume ratio, this architecture is thermodynamically stable and boasts a direct bandgap, making it particularly advantageous for optoelectronic applications.
Scanning electron microscope (SEM)
Fig. 4 depicts the results from a comprehensive morphological analysis carried out on both pure and magnesium-doped (1 %, 1.5 %, and 3 %) nanostructures at various magnification levels. SEM, a widely-used technique for high-resolution imaging of nanostructured materials, was utilized to examine the shape and dimensions of the nanostructures originating from undoped ZnO and the three magnesium-doped samples (ZnO:Mg(1%), ZnO:Mg(1.5%), and ZnO:Mg(3%)). The SEM images taken at diverse magnifications show a dense and consistently distributed pattern of hexagonal particles across all samples.
