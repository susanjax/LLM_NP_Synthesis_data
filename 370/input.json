Reagents used and the preparation of silver nanoparticles (SP-AgNPs)
To synthesize AgNPs, the procedure described by Jain and Mehata [18] and Singhal et al. [19] was followed. The reagents for the nanoparticle synthesis included silver nitrate (AgNO3), extract from S. polyanthum leaves, and distilled water. The bio-reduction process involved mixing 5 mL of a 1 % leaf extract of S. polyanthum with 45 mL of a 1 mM solution containing AgNO3. This facilitated the reduction of Ag + ions to Ag0. UV–vis spectral analysis confirmed the formation of silver nanoparticles.
Although the primary focus of this study was the antibacterial efficacy of SP-AgNPs, the basic characterization of these nanoparticles was also conducted using UV–vis, FTIR, and TEM analysis. The UV–vis examination revealed a prominent peak at 433 nm, which is a characteristic silver absorption band. Furthermore, the FTIR analysis suggested that the leaf extract of S. polyanthum played a dual role as both a reducing and capping agent in the AgNPs synthesis process. The TEM imaging depicted spherical SP-AgNPs with an average particle size of 27.69 nm. This analysis not only confirmed the successful synthesis of SP-AgNPs using an eco-friendly approach but also explains their primary characteristics, including size, shape, and the role of the plant extract in their formation. This primary knowledge serves as a foundation for the assessment of SP-AgNPs as a promising antibacterial agent with potential applications.
