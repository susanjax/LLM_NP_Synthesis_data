Biomaterial sample preparation
HA was synthesized by co-precipitation, as described in Ref. [
20
]. The precursors calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2 – Synth) and phosphoric acid (H3PO4 – Synth) were mixed at a 1.67 M ratio (equation
(1)
), and the syntheses were conducted by using 1 % europium(III) chloride, as structural probe, in relation to the number of mols of Ca2+; HA without added Eu3+ was also prepared. Initially, Ca(NO3)2 was solubilized in 45.0 mL of ethanol (C₂H₆O – Synth) under magnetic stirring at room temperature. After solubilization, H3PO4 and 0.2 mol/L EuCl3 were added, and the reaction mixture was kept under constant stirring for 30 min. The resulting solution was allowed to stand at room temperature for 24 h. Then, it was heated at 85 °C, to eliminate the solvent. The resulting solid was calcined at 900 °C for 3 h, to give a white powder (HA:Eu3+).
9 Ca(NO3)2(s) + 6 H3PO4(aq) + EuCl3(aq) → Ca(9)Eu(1)(PO4)6(OH)2(aq)
After the calcined HA:Eu3+ powder was obtained, a colloidal AgNP solution [
21
] was prepared by dissolving 0.010 g of silver nitrate (AgNO3 – Synth) in 100.0 mL of water followed by stabilization with sodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7 - Dinâmica). After stirring for 10 min, Ag+ was reduced to Ag0 by addition of sodium borohydride (NaBH4 – Sigma Aldrich). In another beaker, a suspension of 0.1 g of HA:Eu3+ was prepared. After 5 min, the colloidal AgNP solution was added to the HA:Eu3+ suspension dropwise under magnetic stirring for 10 min. The resulting solid was separated from the supernatant solution by centrifugation and dried under reduced pressure at 60 °C. The final solid (HA:Eu3+ + AgNPs) was yellow. The supernatant was analyzed by electronic absorption spectroscopy in the ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) region.


The X-ray diffraction in
Fig. 1
a displays the peaks corresponding to the HA crystalline structure irrespective of the presence of the structural probe. The peaks are narrow and well defined (JCPDS 09–0432), in agreement with the literature [
8
,
9
]. The peaks at 2θ = 25.9, 31.8, 32.9, 49.6, 46.8, 34.1, and 48.2° indicate that Eu3+ added as structural probe does not affect the HA structure.
Fig. 1
b shows the peaks at 2θ = 27.8, 31.0, and 34.4°, due to the calcium phosphate phase (JCPDS 03–0690), as well as peaks due to the HA phase (JCPDS 09–0432), indicating that a biphasic ceramic is formed [
28
,
29
]. We identified the presence of AgNPs in HA:Eu3+ + AgNPs by the peaks at 2θ = 37.8, 44.5, and 59.6° (JCPDS 02–1098) [
21
,
30
]. All the diffractograms display a halo in the low-angle region, attributed to the glass sample holder used during the measurements.

In
Fig. 9
 c, various points corresponding to AgNPs with sizes between 0.20 and 0.30 μm (200 and 300 nm) emerge, so the size of just one AgNP could not be determined because AgNPs are agglomerated. At higher magnification (
Fig. 9
 d), particle size could be estimated to lie between 10 and 20 nm, corroborating with the literature [
54
] and UV–vis analysis (
Fig. 4
). This particle size should favor the antibacterial action.
