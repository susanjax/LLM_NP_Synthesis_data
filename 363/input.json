Extract preparation for silver nanoparticles
To prepare the extract for silver nanoparticles, 5 g of dried powdered leaves from Rubus fruticosus were combined with 1000 ml of distilled water in a conical flask. This mixture was then subjected to a 5 minutes boiling process. After boiling, the extract was double-filtered and stored at a temperature of 4 °C for further utilization.

Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
To produce silver nanoparticles, we combined plant extracts with silver nitrate solutions, as outlined in Table 1. We conducted a series of reactions to determine the most effective method for synthesizing AgNPs, involving various concentrations of both plant extract and AgNO3. These reactions utilized equal ratios of plant extract (ranging from 5 mg ml−1 to 1.25 mg ml−1) and AgNO3 solutions (also ranging from 5 mg ml−1 to 1.25 mg ml−1). After mixing 5 ml of each reactant in 15 ml Falcon tubes, the solutions were allowed to interact for 24 hours at room temperature. The alteration in color served as an indicator of Ag nanoparticle formation. The selection of the optimal biosynthesized nanoparticle was based on the evaluation of surface plasmon resonance and peak area.
In the current study, a green synthesis approach was used in which silver NPs were prepared. Leaves of Rubus fruticosus were used to prepare nanoparticles (AgNPs) of interest. As the procedure further proceeded, the antibacterial and antioxidant properties were also determined. The preparation of the required nanoparticles involved the use of silver nitrate at concentrations of 5.0 mg ml−1, 2.5 mg ml−1, and 1.25 mg ml−1, combined in equal proportions with plant volumes of 10 mM, 5 mM, 2.5 mM, and 1.25 mM. The overall pictorial overview of the experiment is given in Fig. 1.
The XRD spectrum provided clear evidence that the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles exist in a nanocrystalline form and possess crystalline attributes when compared to the standard. These peaks can be attributed to the (111), (200), (142), and (311) planes of silver crystals, respectively, as reported by Sathyavathi et al.35 Jemal et al.36 also observed similar results, supporting the characterization of silver nanoparticles as cubic, face-centered, and crystalline.
