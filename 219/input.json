Preparation of graphene oxide nano powder
Nanosized GO was synthesized according to modified Hummers method

[40]
. Natural graphite flake (0.5 g), NaNO3 (0.5 g), and H2SO4 (23 mL) were mixed under vigorous stirring in an ice bath followed by the slow and cautious addition of KMnO4 (3 g). Then the mixture was transferred to a water bath in which temperature was maintained for 35 °C and stirred for 1 h. Distilled water (40 mL) was added and the bath temperature was increased up to 90 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min followed by the addition of 100 mL of distilled water. Next, dropwise addition of 30 % H2O2 (3 mL) was carried out to stop the reaction. The obtained reaction mixture was centrifuged (10000g) and washed using de-ionized (DI) water to obtain a neutral pH. The resultant filter cake was dried using a hot air oven and redispersed into DI water to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. The final solution was sonicated for 90 min to produce fine GO powder

The particle size, morphology and nanostructure of the formulated conjugate was determined by comparing micrographs of graphite and GO with GO-DP1 obtained by conducting FESEM (
Fig. S2
) and High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) (
Fig. 2
e). Images of commercially procured pristine graphite presented in
Fig. 2
e (i) illustrates the presence of crumpled and closely stacked flake-like structure having multiple layers. GO was synthesized by application of sonication along with chemical oxidation procedure that leads to an exfoliated sheet-like structure having folds
[60]
. Presence of oxygen moieties on the surface and edges is responsible for the formation of fractures and wrinkles on the GO morphology, which in turn provides an increased surface for peptide attachment

.

HR-TEM images of GO-DP1 demonstrates formation of spherical hybrids (
Fig. 3
a iii). The particle size of the GO-DP1 hybrids was found to be 32 nm in diameter. Through Eq.
(1)
, it was inferred that 24 peptide molecules were bound to GO after covalent functionalization. In addition, the spherical hybrids seemed well dispersed and did not show agglomeration which can be attributed to size control capabilities of the peptide
[62]
. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of graphite, GO and GO-DP1 were obtained in the range of 0–5.8 V, 2.1–5.1 V and 0–1.5 V, respectively (
Fig. 3
 b). The topology of graphite consisted of large globular clusters attributed to the aggregation of multi-layered sheets
[63]
. A similar topology was observed in HR-TEM micrographs as well (
Fig. 3
a). GO micrographs depicted the presence of a smooth flake-like topology having sharp edges. The sheets seemed to be closely packed with presence of wrinkles on the surface. The existence of covalently bound oxygen moieties along with displacement of hybridized carbon atoms during oxidation reaction, majorly accounts for increased thickness
[64]
. The GO-DP1 micrograph revealed a change in height with respect to GO alone that can be ascribed to the adhered peptide on GO surface, thereby resulting in a 2.5 µm thick GO-DP1 nanoformulation.
