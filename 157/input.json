2.2. Preparation of S. jambolanum nanoparticles
2.2.1. S. jambolanum leaf extract preparation
The young leaves of S. jambolanum were collected and washed with tap water to remove debris. The leaves were then dried using blotting papers. The leaves were dried before being finely ground using a mortar and pestle

2.2.3. Preparation of 1 mM silver nitrate [AgNO3] solution
For the preparation of the 1 mM solution, 0.017gms of AgNO3 was added to 100 ml of double distilled water. The combined solution was transferred to a dark amber bottle preventing any oxidation of silver [Ag]

2.2.4. Green synthesis of S. jambolanum Ag NPs
The synthesis of plant mediated Ag NPs involves mixing the leaf extract and 1 mM AgNO3 solution in 1:4 ratio. The mixture is stirred constantly on a hot plate at 70–80°C for 30 min or until the solution color changes to light brownish color

 Characterization of S. jambolanum silver nanoparticles

The SEM images of S. jambolanum of AgNPs are provided in
Fig. 5
 and shows the spherical shapes obtained as a result of the different leaf extracts being used as reducing and capping agents.
Further Kadam et al.
[32]
 revealed that cauliflower waste – AgNPs SEM analysis showed nanoparticles ranging in size between 20.2 to 24.5 nm.
