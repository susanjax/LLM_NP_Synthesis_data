Synthesis of tGO
Thermal Graphene oxide was prepared by a thermal shock of intercalated graphite. Briefly, flakes of graphite (1 g) were added to a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid at different weight ratios, in the presence of potassium permanganate (1 g) and mixed by a rod glass at room temperature for 3 min. In the next step, the modified intercalated graphite was transferred to a ceramic holder and subjected to a temperature of 650 degrees in a tube furnace for 15 to 19 s to finally form the tGO.
Synthesis of trGO
The same steps as intGO synthesis were redone with only one modification. The thermal reduced graphene oxide was prepared from the same modified intercalated graphite but in this protocol the mixture was exposed to a temperature of 850 degrees.
The particle size distribution of tGO, trGO and tGO/Ag, trGO/Ag nanocomposites is measured using DLS (Dynamic Light Scattering). As shown in Table 1, after sonication, the nanoparticle size of tGO and trGO were estimated at 147.9 nm and 118.2 nm respectively. That may be attributed to the non-spherical morphology of graphene-based materials, the model-derived diameters don’t gives completely real sizes [31]. The size of tGO/Ag and trGO/Ag were estimated at 54.4 nm and 56.2 nm respectively which is lower than trGO and tGO. That may be due to interaction between tGO (and trGO) and Ag particles. The DLS shows an indication of the size difference of our nanoparticles tested.
 Scanning electron microscopy SEM
The SEM imaging of neat graphite, tGO, trGO, and tGO-Ag, trGO-Ag nanocomposites morphologies is shown in Fig. 4. Primarily, the morphology of graphite neat appears as unevenly sized flakes Fig. 4a. Observing the photographs of Fig. 4b, a good-exfoliated tGO is noted, with a folder-like sheet with wrinkles and folds on the surface of the material. This wrinkles and folds shape occur due to the interactions between the carbon structures and functional groups containing oxygen located between the sheets and their edges [25]. The trGO formed agglomerated sheets Fig. 4cas a result of the strong van der waals forces among nanosheets after the oxygenic groups on the tGO surface being removing leading to a decrease in the distance between layers of the tGO [26], [27]. Obviously, the Ag nanoparticles formed large amounts of micronsized aggregates [28]. SEM imaging in Fig. 5show a very good dispersion of AgNPs as a spherical core intercalated into the interlayers of both of tGOand trGO nanosheets that confirms the successful loading process of AgNPs. Interestingly, it was easy to see in Fig. 5b that AgNPs aggregates on the trGO surface. While there well dispersed on the tGO surface Fig. 5a without forming distinct aggregates. These results can be explained by the interaction between AgNPs and tGO (and trGO) nanosheets. When the tGO-Ag nanosystemswas built, a strong interaction was produced between oxygen-containing functional groups and AgNPs leading to a enhanced dispersion. However, the aggregate form in trGO-Ag nanosystems may be due to narrow distance between the surfaces of nanoparticles caused by the attractive van der waals force and/or the driving force that tends to minimize the total surface energy of the system [29], [30]. We caninfer that the AgNPs decoration and dispersion enhance with the oxygen-containing group’s interaction rather than the sp2 carbon basal surfaces.
