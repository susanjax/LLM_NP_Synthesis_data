Synthesis of silver/silver chloride nanoparticles
For the synthesis of AgNPs nanoparticles, the AgNO3 solution was mixed with the clear solution of a combined extract from flowers and leaves of Pandanus foetidus and Alangium salvifolium at a concentration of 4 mM. After an incubation period of 2 h in the sunlight, the reaction process from Ag+ to Ag0 with the formation of a dark brown color provides the visual conformation for the biosynthesis of AgNPs. Nonetheless, for 45 days, the solution with several AgNO3 concentrations was monitored using UV–Vis spectra at various intervals.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
The SEM images reveal a nano-sized, spherically shaped, dispersed structure of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles that stuck to one another as a result of agglomeration formation. The resulting nanoparticles had an average particle size of about 23.9 nm (Fig. 3A). Using leaf extract from Alangium salvifolium, Linga Raom et al. reported the synthesis of spherical AgNPs with an average size of 24.2 to 52.5 nm [20]. Yet, a number of investigations showed that the majority of the biogenic AgNPs that are formed are spherical [1].
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to describe the resulting AgNPs, which were spherically shaped monodispersed particles with smooth edges, the majority of which were circular (Fig. 3B). The range of particle sizes was around 19–39 nm, with an estimated average size of 23.9 nm (Fig. 3C and 3D). This study additionally verified that the produced AgNPs exhibited agglomeration and crystallinity. The size difference in the manufactured nanoparticles could be attributed to variations in sample preparation, extraction, and synthesis procedures. According to multiple studies, the preponderance of plant-mediated AgNPs had spherical shapes with average sizes of 25–50 nm. [37].
Using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), an X-ray generator with 40 kV- 50 mA and θ/2θ scanning mode, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of silver nanoparticles was captured. The XRD data demonstrated the crystal-like nature of the nanoparticles. When AgNPs were compared to the standard powder diffraction card of the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS), silver file No. 04–0783, the formation of AgNPs was confirmed from the reflection peaks of 38.21°, 44.36°, 64.58° and 77.57°, which correspond to the crystallographic planes of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) for synthesized nanoparticles (Fig. 5B). The high-intensity reflection at 38.21° suggests that this plane is where the crystallites are primarily orientated. Based on the Debye-Scherrer equation, the produced AgNPs were found to have a face-centered cubic form with an average crystallite size of 23.5 nm, According to XRD study. Some additional unassigned (*) peaks with the lowest relevancy were also noticed, indicating that the bio-organic phase crystallization took place on the surface of the silver nanoparticles in addition to the Bragg peaks of silver nanocrystals, acting as capping agents [35], [50].
