Synthesis of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on TiO2 nanotubes (NTs)
Highly ordered titanium oxide nanotubes substrate was prepared by electrochemical anodic oxidation of Ti sheet with regards to the literature
[36]
. Ti sheets with an area of 2 × 2.5 cm and thickness of 0.25 mm were used as starting material to attain the TiO2 NTs. All Ti pieces were washed with deionized water and degreased by means of an ultrasonic bath in isopropanol, acetone, washed with deionized water and air-drying. The anodic method was achieved at room temperature via electrochemical cell of two-electrodes with a Ti plate as anode and a Pt plate as cathode and the distance between them was retained at 10 mm. The substrates were prepared by the use of an anodizing voltage of 20 V and the DC power supply (E3612A, Agilent Technologies) connected to 5.5 Digit Multimeter. The system was connected to a personal computer (pc) to draw (I-t) using Excel Intuilink in 0.5 wt% HF solution for 20 min. After anodization, samples were washed with deionized water and the as-anodized TiO2 NTs was therefore annealed at 450 °C in N2 atmosphere (distinctive as TiO2 NTs –N2) for three hrs with heating and cooling rate of 5 °C min−1 to induce anatase crystallization

Pt was deposited on titanium oxide nanotubes annealed in nitrogen (TiO2 NTs –N2) via adding 7.4X10-3 M H2PtCl6·6H2O and 0.0741 M NaBH4 as reducing agent in 25 ml beaker. The electroless deposition method was accomplished at 63 °C for 1800 s (30 min) and pH 13 by adding NaOH solution to 25 ml beaker in water bath.
After the annealing procedure, the Pt nanoparticles loaded on titanium oxide nanotubes (Pt NPs/TiO2 NTs-N2) were separated out from Ti sheet via a mechanical bending technique. This caused the fracture of layers into packages of nanotubes as in

 displays the XRD pattern of Pt NPs/ TiO2 NTs-N2 catalyst. The diffraction peaks display the existence of Ti, TiO2 and Pt phases. The sample Pt NPs/ TiO2 NTs-N2 shows well defined reflections indicating a dissimilar particle size. From the XRD it can be concluded that Pt (2 0 0) and Pt (2 2 0) crystal faces for Pt NPs/ TiO2 NTs-N2 are clear. This point to that grade of preferential orientation of Pt (2 0 0) and Pt (2 2 0) crystal faces are high in the Pt NPs/ TiO2 NTs-N2 sample, which can be ascribed to the mixture of boron with Pt deposited on TiO2 Ns-N2 support
