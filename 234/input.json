 Preparation of PVA/Chitosan blend
0.5 gram of both PVA and Chitosan was dissolved in 50 ml of Ultra-Pure water with addition of 1 ml of Acetic Acid. The polymer mixture solution was continuously stirred at 50 °C for 4 h once homogeneous viscous fluid was established.

2.3. Preparation of PVA/Chitosan/SeNPs nanocomposite by Laser Ablation route
Selenium nanoparticles were doped and distributed in the PVA/Chitosan blend via laser ablation. Selenium plate with suitable dimension immersed and have been ablated in the PVA/Chitosan solution by incident the nanosecond laser beam on the surface of selenium plate. This step called one-pot laser ablation route that have been discussed in detailed in previous works

[47]
. The studied PVA/Chitosan blend doped by different ratios of selenium nanoparticles were performed via traditional casting method.

The prepared PVA/Chitosan/SeNPs nanocomposite films have been created using solution casting technique; the solution of each sample was poured onto plates and dried in the furnace at 45 °C for 3 days. The thickness of prepared films was in the range of 0.2 mm.

Analysis of XRD has provided a great deal of useful knowledge about size, crystal structure and orientation of the compounds.

 show XRD of PVA, chitosan, PVA/Chitosan and PVA/Chitosan/ SeNPs at different laser ablation time at room temperature from 2θ ranging from 10-80 º. The XRD of pure PVA sample as shown in
Fig. 1
e exhibits a diffraction peak 2θ = 19.7 º and 40.4ºbecause of the semi-crystalline PVA structure that assisted by the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, Also, It has low intensity diffraction peak at 2θ = 22.7º

 while chitosan in

. The polymer blend PVA/Chitosan, shows two diffraction peaks at 2θ = 11.2º and 20 º that is mean that semi-crystalline nature of PVA is decreased and affected by blending it with chitosan and the characteristic of each polymer disappeared due to hydrogen bonding between PVA (O-H group) and chitosan (NH2 or O-H group). This means that PVA and chitosan are strongly interacted with each other.
The size of SeNPs can be determined by using Scherrer’s formula

where L is the crystal size, k is a constant (0.915), λ is the X-ray wavelength and equal to 0.154 nm, β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak (in radian) and θ is the Bragg’s diffraction angle (in degree) of the peak maximum. The average crystal size of SeNPs was found to be 17 nm.
