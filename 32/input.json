Synthesis of Biogenic AgNPs
Complete A. hierochuntica L. (Kaff Maryam) plants and A. absinthium seeds were obtained from a local market in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Aqueous extracts of each plant were prepared via addition of water to the powder at a 10:1 (w:v) ratio. The mixtures were immediately heated to 80°C for 10 min for enzyme deactivation. Next, Whatman Grade No. 1 filter paper (diameter of 125 mm and mean pore size of 11 μm was used to filter the mixtures, and the supernatants were retained for use in AgNP synthesis. For AgNP synthesis, 10 ml of plant extract was combined with 90 ml of AgNO3 solution (1 mM) in a flask. The reaction was kept at room temperature in the dark for 48 h until a stable dark color developed. The mixture was then stored at 4°C.
Characterization of Biogenic AgNPs
Addition of the plant extracts to a solution of AgNO3 yielded mixtures that changed from pale yellow to brown-yellow for An-AgNPs and Ar-AgNPs prepared from A. hierochuntica (An) (Supplementary Files A,B) and A. absinthium (Ar) extracts (Supplementary Files C,D).
An-AgNPs and Ar-AgNPs showed mean sizes of 114 ± 2.04 and 125.5 ± 2.5 nm, respectively, as measured via DLS technique (Table 1 and Figures 1A,B). Measurement of the zeta potential returned values of −1.2 and −0.4 mV for An-AgNPs and Ar-AgNPs, respectively. TEM imaging showed that the An-AgNPs were well dispersed and spherical with no significant aggregation (Figure 2). The Ar-AgNPs were semispherical or had no well-defined shape, but no aggregation was observed (Figure 3).
