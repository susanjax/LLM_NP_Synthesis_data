Preparation of zinc oxide nanoparticles
The leaves of Ipomoea aquatica were collected from the B.I.T Mesra campus in Ranchi, Jharkhand. To remove any dust particles, the leaves were thoroughly rinsed with water, followed by double distilled water. For the preparation of Zinc oxide nanoparticles, two separate solutions were prepared: one containing Ipomoea aquatica leaf extract and the other containing Zinc sulfate (procured from RFCL limited, Ankleshwar, Gujrat, India). The leaf extract solution was loaded into a 5 ml syringe and gradually added drop by drop to the Zinc sulfate solution. This was done while maintaining continuous stirring at a temperature of 70 °C. Subsequently, the solution was subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for a duration of 10 min, after which the supernatant was removed. The remaining residue underwent lyophilization, resulting in a dried form that was collected, stored, and reserved for subsequent characterization and potential future applications (

. Within this process, the plant extract's phytochemical components play a vital role by serving as reducing agents, facilitating the conversion of metal precursors into metal nanoparticles.

characterization
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis was employed to determine the hydrodynamic size, polydispersity index, and surface zeta potential of the Zinc oxide nanoparticles that were synthesized, all within a colloidal aqueous setting. The resultant size of the prepared zinc oxide nanoparticle was found to be 67.70 nm, with a PDI of 0.035 as shown in

(a). Zeta potential analysis serves primarily to assess the stability of nanoparticles. The investigation of zeta potential unveiled that the Zinc oxide nanoparticles held a negative surface charge, with a measured zeta potential of −3.08 mV, depicted in
Fig. 3
(b). This observation signifies the substantial stability of the synthesized Zinc oxide nanoparticles. In general, zeta potential values within the range of −30 to +30 mV are indicative of exceptionally stable suspensions (
