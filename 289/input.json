Preparation of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) and zeolite+Ag-NPs

The synthesis of the silver colloid involved a chemical reduction method

, with all reactant solutions prepared using distilled water. In a standard procedure, 50 mL of 0.001 M AgNO3 was heated up to the boiling point of water, followed by the gradual addition of 5 mL of a 1% trisodium citrate (TSC) solution as the reducing agent. Throughout this process, the solutions were vigorously mixed and heated until a discernible change in color occurred, resulting in a pale yellow hue

. Silver ions were introduced into the porous zeolite lattice through an ion-exchange process, leading to the formation of Ag-NPs within the zeolite framework. The nanoporous crystals within the zeolite allow us to control particle size and achieve a uniform distribution of Ag-NPs on the internal surface, serving as an excellent example of modified zeolite.

The integration of Ag-NPs within the zeolite matrix was achieved without the need for heat treatment, utilizing zeolite as the substrate, silver nitrate as the inorganic support, a chemical reducing agent, and a dispersant substance. Sodium citrate played an important role in preventing the aggregation of nanoparticles, ensuring the maintenance of the smallest possible grain size. The process involved the introduction of silver ions into the porous zeolite network through ion exchange. Subsequently, after the reduction step, Ag-NPs were formed within the zeolite framework, exhibiting an average diameter ranging from approximately 2.12 to 3.11â€‰nm. The presence of nanoporous crystals within the zeolite matrix allowed for precise control over particle size and ensured a consistent distribution of Ag-NPs on the internal surface
