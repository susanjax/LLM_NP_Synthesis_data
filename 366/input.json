 Silver nanoparticles (AgNP) biosynthesis
Leaf aqueous extract of A. nilotica (10 mL) was combined with 90 mL of 1 M silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution (Fig. 2a) and stirrered at 60 °C for 30 minutes. Initially, the pale yellow tint turned dark brown, indicating the formation of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) (Fig. 2b), as silver ions were reduced by the A. nilotica extract, resulting in stable AgNP in water. Then reactant solution was subjected to centrifugation for 15 minutes at 5000 rpm, after which the pellet was collected and dehydrated overnight in a hot air oven set to 60 °C. Pellets were saved and used for analysis. and bioassays.
The primary change in color from pale yellow to dark brown indicated the synthesis of AgNP using A. nilotica's aqueous leaf extract and silver nitrate. The reduction of Ag+ ions causes surface plasmon resonance vibration, which is necessary for the formation of AgNP. Measurements of the absorbance peak at 428 nm indicated AgNP biogenesis using A. nilotica leaf extract. The XRD pattern of AgNP shows strong peaks at 2ᶿ-38.31, 43.54, 64.62, and 77.46, corresponding to the (111), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), and (2 2 2) Bragg's reflections of the face-centered cubic structure of silver (Fig. 3). The AgNP size was calculated from X-ray line broadening using the Debye-Scherrer formula given as D- 0.9lambda/βcosᶿ, where D is the average crystallographic size (ɺ), λ is the X-ray wavelength employed (nm), β is the angular line width at half maximum intensity (radians), and _ is the Braggs angle (degrees). For (1 0 1) reflection at 2ᶿ = 38.13, for β - 0.367200 radians, λ-1.54 ɺ, and ᶿ ≈ 19.06, the average size of the AgNP is predicted to be roughly 25 nm. Parts of plant extract-assisted NP biosynthesis have gained prominence due to the existence of numerous secondary metabolites (terpenoids, alkaloids, phenols, and tannins), which act as reducing and stabilizing agents for bioreduction and the creation of unique metallic nanoparticles
SEM pictures (Fig. 4) of samples taken from colloidal Ag solutions generated at 80 °C confirm the presence of extremely small and regularly manufactured NP with irregular forms that mimic colloidal particles and can be uniformly disseminated within a solution. Green AgNP synthesized by A. nilotica varied in size and form, but they demonstrated strong antibacterial and anticancer activity (Revathi et al., 2017). The SEM images reveal that larger particles of AgNP are formed as a result of nanoparticle aggregation, which could be produced by solvent evaporation during sample preparation. This could explain the different particle sizes. The elemental composition of powdered materials was evaluated using SEM (JEOL-JSM 6610 LV).
