Preparation of silver nanoparticles (A5, A10, A15 and A20)
At room temperature, HCS extract (5 ml) was mixed with 0.4 mM of AgNO3 and it was subjected to a stirring process in a magnetic stirrer. The HCS extract used for the preparation of silver nanoparticles, slowly reduces Ag+ ions to Ag0 ions, with 8 h of reaction. The complete reduction of silver was confirmed by the obtained brown colored solution which was noted as A5, A10, A15 and A20 were prepared by using 10, 15 and 20 ml of extract in the preparation of silver nano colloids. The dried powders of A5, A10, A15 and A20 were used for various characterizations such as UV-visible (UV-vis), Transmission Electron Micrograph (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 1 is a schematic representation of HCS as a source for the environmentally friendly synthesis of silver nanoparticles, along with an explanation of its characteristics and uses.
Characterization of A5, A10, A15 and A20
The dried powders of HCS extract and Ag-NPs synthesized from HCS extract (A5 and A20) are illustrated in Fig. 3. The XRD patterns of A5 show diffraction peaks at 38.190 (111), 44.320 (200), 64.510 (220) and 77.340 (311). While, the XRD patterns of A20 show diffraction peaks at 38.210 (111), 44.340 (200), 64.470 (220) and 77.310 (311). These can be attributed to the face-centered cubic (FCC) structure of silver [59,60]. With the Braggs peaks of FCC structure of Ag, some weaker peaks appeared at 260, 32.250 and 46.210, owing to the bio-molecules from HCS extract occurring on the silver surface [61,62]. The average size of the A5 and A20 was calculated by Debye-Scherer's equation of 17 nm and 4 nm respectively.
The observed particle size gets decreased with increasing HCS extract in the preparation of Ag-NPs. The lattice constant (a) of A5 and A20 was calculated as 4.0832 Å and 4.0764 Å, respectively. The observed cell volume (V) of A5 and A20 was calculated as 68.07 Å3 and 67.74 Å3 respectively. The specific surface area of A5 and A20 was calculated as 54.62 m2/g and 74.45 m2/g respectively. Surface area to volume (SA:V) ratio of A5 and A20 was calculated as 0.38 and 0.66 respectively. The values of specific surface area and SA:V closely increased with increasing HCS extract. The observed lattice constant is in good agreement with JCPDS: 04-0783 and the sample exhibits smaller cell volumes while increasing HCS extract from 5 ml to 20 ml in the preparation of Ag-NPs. Earlier workers reported similar results for Ag nanoparticles [63,64].
To distinguish the morphology of A5 and A20, the TEM is analyzed and shown in Fig. 4. The TEM images of A20 (Fig. 4 (ii)) show spherical-shaped very small particles in a range between 1.67 nm and 11.67 nm with an average of ∼4.71 nm. The phenolic compounds, terpenoids, alkaloids, enzymes, sugars and proteins in HCS extract reduce Ag0 into Ag+when it is mixed with silver nitrate solutions [65]. The 20 ml of extract contains a large number of biomolecules, which promotes a rapid reaction rate and the production of nanoparticles with small sizes. 20 ml of HCS extract rapidly reduces silver nitrate, creates new/secondary nuclei and produces a narrow sized particle distribution and monodispersion. This 20 ml of HCS extract has the possibility of forming a mono-layer on the surface of particles to prevent agglomeration. With 5 ml of HCS extract, it can slow down the reaction due to the cancellation of secondary nucleation against primary nucleation. The TEM images of A5 (Fig. 4 (i)) show agglomerated spherical shaped small particles ranging between 5.33 nm and 58.6 nm with an average of ∼15.06 nm. These observed results (Fig. 4.) are in accordance with the shape of SPR bands of A5 and A20 colloids. Thus, the number of phenolic compounds (strong reductant) in the HCS extract strongly influences the reduction, capping and particle size distribution of the prepared nanoparticles.
