Synthesis and characterization of AgNPs
For this study, AgNPs were synthesized according to the previously published Tollens process that involves reduction of the complex cation [Ag(NH3)2]+ by d-maltose in alkaline media [49]. The concentrations of all the reaction components were as follows: silver nitrate, 1 × 10−3 mol dm−3 (mass concentration corresponded to 108 mg/L of Ag); ammonia, 5 × 10−3 mol dm−3; sodium hydroxide, 9.6 × 10−3 mol dm−3, and d-maltose as a reducing agent, 1 × 10−2 mol dm−3.
The reaction mixture was continuously stirred with a magnetic stirrer. Synthesis of AgNPs was carried out at the laboratory temperature (approx. 21 °C). In addition, AgNPs were stabilized during preparation by adding gelatin to the dispersion at a final concentration of 0.05%, in order to prevent partial aggregation caused by introduction to the culture medium.
Tollens process, a well-known and reliable method, was used to synthesize AgNPs. This process produces AgNPs of a specific size, 28 nm in diameter, with a very narrow size distribution, as confirmed by TEM (Fig. 1). The surface plasmon resonance (a typical measure of adsorption of material onto metal nanoparticle surfaces) of these AgNPs was recorded at a wavelength of 405 nm (Fig. 1), proving their small size. The AgNPs were stabilized with 0.05% gelatin to prevent possible aggregation after addition to culture media, which contains highly concentrated electrolytes. Only stabilized, non-aggregated AgNPs produce high antibacterial activity.
