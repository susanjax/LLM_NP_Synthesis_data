Biosynthesis of AgNPs
SNPs were synthesized using the method with a few changes as described
[19]
. The reaction was carried out in a dark environment to avoid photo-activation of the AgNO3 (≥99.0 %, Merck) at room temperature. The color shift of the reaction solution indicated the formation of SNPs in the solution. After 24 h, the colloidal mixture was centrifugated for 10 min at 15,000 rpm. The pellet was again centrifuged after re-dispersing in deionized water, and this process was repeated thrice. The purified SNPs powder was used for field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis

FESEM and EDX study of SNPs
FESEM is a useful tool that provides insight into the morphology of NPs. A FESEM micrograph of SNPs shows that SNPs have a circular shape (
Fig. 3
a). The particle size distribution of SNPs was determined through a histogram drawn using ImageJ software. It was found that particles were distributed in the size range of 1 to 100 nm, with a median size of 21.43 nm (
Fig. 3
b). These results are well correlated with the previous work that showed SNPs attain a spherical shape
[31]
. The results are in line with those of
[32]
, who produced well-dispersed, spherical SNPs with a size range of 5 to 50 nm from Brevundimonas diminuta. The EDX spectrum of SNPs is displayed in
Fig. 3
c, which shows a strong silver signal peak at 2.9 keV because of SPR. EDX results confirm the presence of elemental silver. Cl and C peaks were also discovered in these nanoparticles, which are thought to have formed due to the presence of precipitates from the leaves' extract.

 XRD study of SNPs
By XRD analysis, determination of the crystalline phase of synthesized SNPs was achieved. The XRD pattern of SNPs is shown in
Fig. 4
. When compared to the normal powder diffraction card of Ag file, the spectrum showed four sharp peaks at 37.95°, 44.05°, 64.30°, and 78.45°, which could correspond to Miller indices of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) planes

[34]
. These results are in agreement with previous work
