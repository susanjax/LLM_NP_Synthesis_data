Synthesis of silver nanoparticles.
Ag+ ions were reduced by addition of 5 mL of D. bulbifera tuber extract to 95 mL of 10−3 M aqueous AgNO3 solution. Reduction of the Ag+ ions was monitored by measuring the ultraviolet-visible spectrum of the solution at regular intervals on a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) operating at a resolution of 1 nm. The effects of temperature on the rate of synthesis and size of the prepared silver nanoparticles were studied by carrying out the reaction in a water bath at 4°C–50°C with reflux. The concentration of AgNO3 solution was also varied from 0.3 to 5 mM.

Characterization of silver nanoparticles.
The shape and size of the synthesized nanoparticles were elucidated with the help of TEM and HRTEM. The TEM images confirmed formation of silver nanoparticles (Figures 5 and ​and6).6). Formation of silver nanotriangles is a very rare event. The majority were formed as silver nanorods and triangles in the size range of 8–20 nm (Figure 5A). HRTEM images clearly show that the nanoparticles were mostly spherical in shape. Nanoparticles of larger dimensions (about 75 nm) were observed. TEM and HRTEM analysis also occasionally demonstrated hexagonal nanoparticles along with the triangles and rods (Figures 5C and ​6D). The silver nanoparticles were anisotropic and included triangular, spherical, and ellipsoidal particles (Figure 5D, E, and F). 
The diffraction data for the dry powder were recorded on a Brucker x-ray diffractometer using a Cu Kα (1.54 Å) source. Phase formation was confirmed from characteristic peaks such as (111), (200), (220), and (311). The data matched with the standard Joint Committee for Powder Diffraction Set, Card 040783, confirming a face-centered cubic structure for the silver nanoparticles (Figure 9).
