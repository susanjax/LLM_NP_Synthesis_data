Preparation of Co1.5Mn1.5O4 nanozyme
In the synthesis of Co1.5Mn1.5O4 nanozyme, Co(NO3)2⋅6H2O and Mn
(NO3)2⋅4H2O with the molar ration 1:1 was dissolved in 20 mL of
deionized water. Then, 5 mL nitric acid was added to the solution under
magnetic stirring at room temperature. Afterwards, 10 mL ethylene
glycol was added and the mixture was heated at 80 ◦C until a viscous gel
is formed. The resultant gel was dried at 120 ◦C for 24 h. The solid was
ground in an agate mortar and heated at 400 ◦C in a preheated oven in
air for 3 h.
Morphology and characterization of Co1.5Mn1.5O4
Surface morphology and constitute characterization of the prepared
nanozyme were investigated via SEM, TEM and EDS. Fig. 1a shows that
the prepared Co1.5Mn1.5O4 is in the shape of blocky particle with
average size about 140 nm, which is further proved by TEM image
(Fig. S2). Meanwhile, EDS data verify existence of elements Co, Mn, O in
Co1.5Mn1.5O4 (Fig. S1). XRD was used to confirm the corresponding
crystal structure of Co1.5Mn1.5O4, as displayed in Fig. 1b. All the pronounced peaks could be indexed to (111), (220), (311), (400), (422),
(440), (511) and (533) planes of face-centered-cubic (fcc) Co1.5Mn1.5O4
[31].
