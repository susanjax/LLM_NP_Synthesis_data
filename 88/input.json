Fe3O4-PEG nanoparticles were synthesized following a slightly modified solvothermal process previously reported by Yan et al.20 Experimental details are provided in the Appendix. Core shell nanostructures were synthesized using a variation of the well-known Stöber process. The synthetic pathway for Fe3O4-SiO2-FA particles and Fe3O4-PEG-FA particles is shown schematically in Figure 1, A and B, and experimental details are provided in the Appendix. The Fe3O4-PEG-FA and Fe3O4-SiO2-FA nanoparticles were characterized as described below in Results; experimental details are provided in the Appendix. Endotoxin content was assessed prior to cell experiments as previously described.21
Synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles
Fe3O4-PEG nanoparticles were synthesized following a slightly modified solvothermal process previously reported by Yan et al.2 0.08 g (0.3 mmol) of FeCl3∙6H2O was dissolved in 24 ml ethylene glycol. Afterwards 2.04 g (15.0 mmol) NaOAc∙3H2O was added to the colloidal solution followed by the addition of 2.30 g (8.0 mmol) SDS and 4.20 g (7.0 mmol) PEG. The mixture was vigorously stirred for 15 min and transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was heated to 180°C for 6 h and allowed to cool down to room temperature. The resulting solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 4400 rpm, washed several times with absolute ethanol and acetone, respectively, and dried at 60°C for 24 h.
Synthesis of folic acid-conjugated Fe3O4 nanoparticles
Core shell nanostructures were synthesized using a variation of the well-known Stöber process; see Scheme 1A and 1B for an overview. Hence, 0.13 g of as prepared Fe3O4 nanoparticles were dispersed in 100 ml isopropanol and 0.5 g (0.38 µmol) PVP were added under vigorous stirring. After 24 h a mixture of 10 ml distilled water and 50 ml isopropanol was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for additional 30 minutes. The pH was adjusted to 10 by using NH3. Then 0.1 g (0.48 mmol) TEOS were added and the reaction mixture was aged for further 20 h. The resulting solution was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4400 rpm and washed several times with acetic acid, absolute acetone and distilled water, respectively. The precipitate was collected and redispersed in ethanol with a concentration of 0.02 g/ml. To introduce an appropriate linker for the final functionalization with folic acid APTMS was introduced on the particle surface. Therefore, 0.2 ml (1.1 mmol) APTMS were added to 5 ml of the Fe3O4-SiO2-solution and stirred vigorously for 12 h. The solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 4400 rpm and washed three times with absolute ethanol to get rid of the APTMS excess. Finally, 4 ml aqueous acetic acid (1 ml acetic acid with 10 ml distilled water) was added into the dispersion of nanoparticles and the reaction mixture was stirred for further 30 minutes. To obtain folic acid-conjugated Fe3O4-SiO2 nanoparticles (Fe3O4-SiO2-FA) a mixture of 0.1 g (0.23 mmol) FA and 36 mg (0.19 mmol) EDC was solved in 5 ml DMSO and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. After addition of 5 ml ethanol containing 0.1 g of the pre-modified nanoparticles Fe3O4-SiO2-NH2 the reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged and washed several times with absolute ethanol and water. For synthesis of Fe3O4-PEG-FA nanoparticles, as-prepared Fe3O4-PEG nanoparticles were modified following the procedure described above for Fe3O4-SiO2-FA.
Characterization of NPs
Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by solvothermal decomposition of iron salt in aqueous media. TEM analysis of Fe3O4-PEG particles showed spherical morphology with a narrow size distribution and an average primary particle size of 18.4 nm (Figure 2, A). The HR-TEM additionally proves the high crystallinity of the particles and the formation of the Fe3O4 phase (Figure 2, B). The phase structure was further confirmed by XRD analysis (Figure 2, C) and is corroborated by the ferrimagnetic behavior of the particles reaching a saturation magnetization (MS) of 31.1 emu/g as seen in the hysteresis curve in Figure 2, D.
