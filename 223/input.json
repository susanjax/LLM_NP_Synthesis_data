Synthesis of CuO nanoparticles
Copper oxide was prepared using precipitation technique by the following procedure. 2 g of (CuCl2).2H2O and 1.5 g of NaOH were grinded for 5 mins separately. Both the mixtures were combined together and were grinded for another 5 mins and then dissolved in distilled water. Then 6 ml of PEG was added to this mixture and the grinding was continued for another 45 mins. The solution is filtered using a whatman filter paper and the filtrate was annealed at 200 °C for 3 h in muffle furnace. Here PEG acts as a shaping agent enhancing the Nano structural formation.
Characterization of CuO NPs
The Powder XRD pattern of CuO sample is shown in
Fig. 1
, and all diffraction peaks can be indexed to the monoclinic phase of CuO crystals (JCPDS 80-1268). No peaks of impurity are detected in the XRD patterns, indicating that pure crystalline CuO was fabricated by the presented procedures. The sharp and intense peaks indicate the good crystalline nature of the samples. The major peak located at 39° corresponds to characteristic diffraction pattern of CuO. The particle size of the synthesized powder was determined by the X-Ray line broadening method using the scherrer equation.
The morphology of as-prepared CuO was studied with SEM as shown in
Fig. 2
a and b for CuO with PEG 600 respectively, which provides direct information about the size and typical morphologies of the synthesized powders, SEM pictures reveal that the synthesized powder has uniform distribution of particles and the picture exactly shows the Nano particles with having average size of 94 nm. Similarly the addition of shaping agent PEG 600 has the manipulated the size and the structure of CuO. In particular the adhesive polymer acts as an interbridge and forms Nano rods of average diameter 37 nm. The Chemical composition of the Nano rod was confirmed by recording Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) spectrum. It shows in
