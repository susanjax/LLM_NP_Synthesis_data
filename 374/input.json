Synthesis
AgNO3 was blended in distilled water to formulate 1 and 5 mM AgNO3 solutions. To synthesize Ag-NPs from plant sources, AgNO3 was used as a precursor solution [7]. The 1 mM AgNO3 solutions were blended in aqueous extract of P. plebeium, L. glutinosa, and V. spinosus dried leaves at a ratio of 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8 (v/v) to the volume of 10 mL in a falcon tube as shown in Table 2.
Finally, for the topographic detail, FESEM was performed and the result determined the mean diameter of the surface of synthesized Ag-NPs. The micrograph was gained at various magnification using electron high tension EHT= 5.00KV, Signal A=InLens, and Magnification= 100.00KX. Result shows (Fig 7) the size of synthesized spherical Ag-NPs with an average size of 45–47 nm (45.84, 46.40, 47.04nm) and also largest particle size 352.4nm with working distance (WD) = 3.4mm for 1:4 ratio in 200nm range and 45–86 nm (62.35, 45.51, 86.34, and 52.60nm) with WD = 3.9mm for 1:8 ratio in 100nm range respectively [4, 61].
