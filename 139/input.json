Preparation of nanodispersion and nanoparticles
The details of nanodispersion preparation and ZnO NPs synthesized using Curcumin nanodispersion were described in our previous works
[35][36]. Here it was explained briefly: Curcumin nanodispersion was prepared under subcritical water condition, dissolving 20 mg Curcumin in 1.5 g Tween 80 as an emulsifier. Then this mixture was added dropwise to 98.5 g double-distillation water and was stirred. A sealed Teflon autoclave (Behdad Medical Production Co., SP88, Tehran, Iran) was used to obtain nanodispersion at 120 ºC in an oven for 2 h.
A 0.44 g of zinc nitrate hexahydrate was combined with 100 mL of de-ionized water to produce ZnO. Also, 0.74 g Curcumin was dissolved in 50 mL de-ionized water with 1 mL Tween 80 to make a Curcumin solution. The Curcumin solution was poured into a beaker containing Zinc nitrate solution, and the pH was adjusted between 7 and 10 using 0.1 N NaOH solution to make the ZnO suspension solution. The resultant solution was heated for 2 h at 60 oC and 400 rpm. The suspensions were heated to 160 oC in a Teflon-sealed autoclave for 6 h. The blended solutions were then dried for an hour at 100 oC (
Fig. 1).
Nanoparticles characterization
As shown in
Fig. 2
a-c, the morphology of the prepared Curcumin nanodispersion and synthesized ZnO NPs using Curcumin nanodispersion at pH equal to 7 and 10 were studied through TEM and SEM, respectively. The acquired outcomes showed that spherical Curcumin nanodispersion and ZnO NPs were nanoscales with 10–100 nm particles. The samples were well scattered, with sphere-shaped and harmonic architectures, as shown by the findings. The fact that NPs were sphere-shaped demonstrated that they had the smallest particle size. Moreover, DLS analysis was used to measure the particle size, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta-potential values of the prepared Curcumin nanodispersion and synthesized ZnO NPs.

d and e show the particle size distribution of the prepared Curcumin nanodispersion and synthesized ZnO NPs at pH = 7. The average particle size of the prepared Curcumin nanodispersion and synthesized ZnO NPs were 32 and 85 nm, respectively. The obtained results indicated that the prepared Curcumin nanodispersion and synthesized ZnO NPs had the narrowest distribution with PDI values of 0.06 and 0.16, respectively. The smallest particle size, PDI, and relatively high net values of zeta-potential (−33.2 and −30.1 mV for nanodispersion and ZnO NPs, respectively) confirmed the high surface active functionality and stability of obtained Curcumin nanodispersion and synthesized ZnO NPs. This attribute established high surface energy, thermodynamic, physical, and chemical stability of Curcumin nanodispersion and synthesized ZnO NPs.
