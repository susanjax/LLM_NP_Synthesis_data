Preparation of flower petal extract
The washed floral flakes were dried and 5 gm weighted flakes were immersed in 50 ml distilled water taken in100 ml beaker and boiled for 20 min. After boiling, the extract was cooled and filtered using a Whatman No 1 filter paper and filter paper (size 0.4 m) in a sequence to create a final extract, which was then stored at 4 °C.
Silver nanoparticle synthesis
In a conical flask, 50 ml of 1 mM aqueous silver nitrate was combined with 5 ml of floral flake extract. The solution mixture has been stirred vigorously in a magnetic stirrer for 15 min. The process lasts for 30 min and until the silver ions are reduced to silver particles at room temperature. The hue of the reaction mixture shifted from blue green to brown after 30 min, according to the researchers. It shows that the UV–visible spectrophotometer can guarantee the reduction of silver ions into AgNPs.
Using an extract from the flower petals of Couroupita guianensis, the surface morphology images investigate the size and shape of the produced silver nanoparticles. The SEM characteristics of the prepared nanoparticles Ag are found in Fig. 4(a-b). The SEM illustration exhibited a sponge-like structure of nanoparticles ranging up to 20 nm. The result of hydrodynamic size estimation of silver nanoparticles employed using DLS analysis is given in Fig. 4(c). It shows the average particle size distribution of silver nanoparticles (diameter = 3.2 nm and Standard Deviation = 1.9 µm) is signified within the range of 3.2 nm as listed in (Table 2). It ensures the screening of small particles by larger phytochemicals of couroupita genesis attached to the surface of AgNPs (Manimegalai et al., 2014, Bauer et al., 1966).
