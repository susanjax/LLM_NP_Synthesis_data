Extracellular synthesis of AgNPs
The 24 h grown fresh culture of P. putida MPV2 in the LB broth was centrifuged at 8000 RPM for 10 min to obtain the supernatant. The supernatant was mixed with AgNO3 solution to make a final volume concentration of 1 mM. The supernatant without addition of AgNO3 was maintained as a control. In another set of experiments the 24 h grown culture of P. putida was directly mixed with AgNO3 to adjust the final concentration of 1 mM. The bacterial culture without addition of AgNO3 was maintained as a control. Subsequently, the bioreduction of silver ions was monitored by the visual colour change and UV–visible spectrum analysis of the reaction mixture.
The crystalline structure of biogenic AgNPs was confirmed by XRD. The diffraction spectrum of AgNPs showed face centred cubic (FCC) crystalline nature of four intense peaks (

A) at 38.95°, 45.12°, 65.39° and 78.12° 2θ corresponding to plane values of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) which were consistent with the standard data JCPDS file no. 01-087-0717 (
Khan et al., 2012
). The chemical composition of biogenic AgNPs was obtained from EDAX spectrum analysis (
Fig. 2
B). The resultant spectrum was observed with high intensity signals of Ag which indicated the presence of AgNPs. The signal showed at the Al peak which was used to load AgNPs sample for analysis.
STEM images showed the biogenic AgNPs obtained from the culture supernatant of P. putida were monodispersed, spherical shaped AgNPs with the size ranging from 6 to 16 nm. The nanoparticles images obtained in the different magnification ranges for the nanoparticle surface are shown (

A and B). The average size distribution histogram of synthesized AgNPs is shown in
