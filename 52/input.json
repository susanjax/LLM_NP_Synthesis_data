Synthesis of TiO2 NPs
Bacterial culture was grown in a modified nutrient broth (beef extract 1%, peptone 1%, NaCl 0.5% and pH 7) at 30 °C in an orbital shaker set at 120 rpm for 24 h. 25 ml of culture was taken and diluted four times by adding 75 ml of sterile distilled water containing nutrients. This diluted culture solution was again allowed to grow for another 24 h. 20 ml of 5 mM TiO(OH)2 was added to the culture solution and kept under shaking incubator at 120 rpm at 30 °C for 24 h until white deposition starts to appear at the bottom of the flask, indicating the initiation of transformation. At the end of the reaction time (24 h) the mixture was poured on a sterilized petriplates and air dried. The air dried powder nanoparticles were used for further analytical studies [26], [27], [28].
Characterization of TiO2 NPs
The crystalline nature of the TiO2 NPs was analyzed using XRD. The XRD pattern of the synthesized TiO2 NPs revealed intense peaks at 27.47°, 31.77°, 36.11°, 41.25°, 54.39°, 56.64° and 69.53° corresponding to 1 1 0, 1 0 0, 1 0 1, 1 1 1, 2 1 1, 2 2 0 and 3 0 1 Bragg’s reflection, respectively. Which is found to be that of the rutile form as when compared with the JCPDS data (File No. 99-101-0954). The main peak of 2θ = 27.47° matches the (1 1 0) crystallographic plane of rutile form of TiO2 nanoparticles, indicating that the nanoparticles structure produced is only rutile form and not of anatase or brookite form. The crystallite sizes were calculated using Scherrer’s formula applied to the major intense peaks and found to be in the range of 40.50 nm. The broadening of the peaks clearly shows the small size of the nanoparticles [31], [32].
Particles were of nanosize with smooth surface. Fig. 5A and B shows that the size of the TiO2 NPs was very consistent. EDX showing chemical composition and purity of the TiO2 NPs (Fig. 5C). Fig. 5D shows the particle size distribution. The particle size of the nanoparticles ranges in size from 28 to 54 nm and the individual size of 40.50 nm. The results indicate that these surface planes having different packing structures were energetically similar to each other. The formation of TiO2 NPs synthesized from A. hydrophila with two insets showing the spherical and uneven nanoparticles. The surface of TiO2 NPs was analyzed and the aggregated structures possess considerable surface roughness. The morphological shapes and size of the aggregations were described in terms of the fractal dimensions and box-counting method [34].
