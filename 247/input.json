Preparation of zinc peroxide nanoparticles
Room-temperature synthesis method was modified and developed for the synthesis of ZnO2 nanoparticles. Briefly, 100 ml of 0.01 M zinc acetate dihydrate clear solution was prepared by methanol. 0.075 g sodium borohydride was then added to the solution with continuous stirring for 15 min, then 4.0 ml 15% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was added to the mixture and stirred continuously for another 15 min. Later on, the solution was put in microwave for one minute (1000 Watts) with continues stirring for 5 min and a pale-yellow suspension solution was produced. This suspension was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min, then the precipitate was washed repeatedly by ethanol. The precipitate was dried at 60 °C for 7 h in oven to obtain fine powder.

Further broadened respect could be detected for samples indicating the presence of nanoparticles (
Kurapati et al., 2016
). By measuring the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (1 1 0), (2 0 0), 220 and 311 it was possible to calculate the crystallite sizes of the samples via the well-known Debye Scherer equation. The ZnO2 NP are in the nanometer range as it is proved by the broadening of the XRD reflections and the average crystallite size NPs was about 24 nm as calculated by the Scherer’s equation: D = k.λ/(β.cosθ), where k = 0.9; λ is the wavelength of monochromatic X-ray radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), θ is the Bragg, angle and β is the full width of X-ray pattern line at half peak.

SEM images of synthetic ZnO2 -NPs was showed in
Fig. 3
A and B. The nanoparticles are well dispersed and non-agglomerated in water medium. Moreover, spherical and boundary of individual particles can be noticed. The average particle sizes are in the range of 10–20 nm which is very close to the crystallite size calculated from XRD results.
