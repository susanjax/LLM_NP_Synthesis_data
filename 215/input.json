 Synthesis of silver nanoparticles
Silver nanoparticles aqueous solutions stabilized with citrate (AgNP@CIT), lysozyme (AgNP@LZ), or bovine serum albumin (AgNP@BSA) were prepared by photoreduction of AgNO3 with I-2959 as previously reported [
21
], and is briefly described in section one of Supplementary Material (SM1). AgNP solutions were stored at refrigerator temperature and their colloidal stability was confirmed by monitoring the characteristic surface plasmon band (SPB) of AgNP between 300 and 700 nm by UV–vis spectroscopy as described below. In all cases, almost no changes in absorbance of the SPB were observed after one week of preparation of the solutions.

 Fig. 1
 shows the UV–vis spectra of the surface plasmon band (SPB) of AgNPs obtained after full reduction of Ag+ ions with ketyl radicals generated by photo-fragmentation of the non-toxic benzoin I-2959 in the presence of 1 mM citrate (AgNP@CIT), 10 μM LZ (AgNP@LZ), and 1 μM BSA (AgNP@BSA), respectively. The concentration of each protein used was minimal to obtain stable nano-colloidal solutions of AgNP@LZ [
21
] or AgNP@BSA [
26
], respectively. In all cases, the position of the maximum wavelength (λmax) of SPB was located at <410 nm,
Table 1
], which suggests the formation of small spherical AgNPs with a core diameter less than 10 nm [
27
]. Red-shift and broadening of the SPB of AgNP@LZ and AgNP@BSA relative to that for AgNP@CIT are typical for protein-stabilized AgNPs [

Table 1
 also shows the hydrodynamic diameter (dh) and zeta potential (ζ) values for the prepared AgNPs. For AgNP@CIT, dh = 3 ± 1 nm was similar to dAgNP = 4 ± 1 nm as previously measured by TEM [
21
], as can be expected for a nanoparticle capped with a small molecule. On the other hand, for AgNP@LZ and AgNP@BSA, an average dh = 13.5 ± 4.0 nm was obtained, in agreement with the values previously reported for these nanoparticles [

,
31
]. Then by comparison with the TEM diameters [
31
,
33
], the thickness of the protein corona (rcorona) was estimated ≈ 3.5 nm and 4.5 nm for AgNP@LZ and AgNP@BSA solutions, respectively. These rcorona values can be expected for a monolayer of LZ corresponding to an elongated ellipsoid of 3 × 3 × 4.5 nm [
34
], and for a monolayer of BSA with an equilateral triangular prism shape of 8.4 × 8.4 × 8.4 × 3.2 nm [
35
], respectively. Therefore, the diameter of the spherical metal core can be approximated to dAgNP = dh –2×rcorona, that is, ≈5 nm and ≈6 nm for AgNP@BSA and AgNP@LZ, respectively. These dAgNP values were used to calculate the AgNP concentration of each solution as explained in the supplementary material (section SM2), assuming the complete conversion of the precursors according to the plateau observed in the growth kinetics of the photoreduction reaction (inset of
Fig. 1
). The calculated concentrations are reported in
Table 1
 and were of the same order of magnitude as those calculated using the Lambert-Beer law with a molar extinction coefficient of ≈2 × 108 M−1 cm−1 for AgNP@CIT
