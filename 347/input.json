Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticle
Silver nitrate (AgNO3) was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Bangalore, India). In typical synthesis of silver nanoparticle, 0.2 g of chitosan was dissolved in 1% acetic acid followed by stirring for 30 min. This was then filtered to obtain clear solution. About 0.1 M of 3 mL of freshly prepared AgNO3 and then 100 µL of 1 M NaOH was added to 1% of acetic acid containing chitosan solution. The solution was mixed under stirring for 10 h at 90 °C. The color of the solution was changed from colorless to light yellow and finally to yellowish brown. This indicates the formation of Ag NPs.33
The analysis of the crystalline size and structure of the Ag NPs was carried out by XRD. The XRD pattern of Ag NPs was shown in Fig. 3. The numbers of Bragg reflections with 2θ values of 38.53°, 44.67°, 65.08° and 78.06° corresponding to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) respectively indicated that the Ag NPs were spherical structured and crystalline in nature (JCPDS card no: 65-2871). The sharp peak indicated some bioorganic compounds/proteins in the NPs during synthesis.38 The obtained XRD pattern clearly illustrated that the silver ions have been reduced to AgO by the stabilization of chitosan under reaction condition. The pattern showed the reflection planes that confirmed the presence of face-centered cubic form of metallic silver and no peaks of other impurity crystalline phases were observed.39, 40
