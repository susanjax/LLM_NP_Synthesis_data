Synthesis of AG doped metal oxides
C. pulcherrima flowers (20 g) were picked fresh off the campus of Annai Velankanni College in the Tamil Nadu district of Kanyakumari, India. C. pulcherrima blooms were properly cleaned under running water to guarantee their cleanliness. The flower extract is a pure floral extract made from 20 g of flowers cooked for 10 min. Whatman No. 1 filter paper was then used to filter the resultant plant extract in order to eliminate any undesirable chemicals. After this filtration process effectively cleaned the plant extract, it was stored at 4 °C for further examination.
Ag/TiO2 NPs were created using a solution of titanium (IV) isopropoxide-TTIP at a concentration of 1 M and a solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3) at a concentration of 0.1 M. The synthesis was started using 10 mL of plant extract and the previously specified solutions. It was then dissolved in 100 mL of room-temperature double-distilled water. The hue of the solution obviously altered when the final mixture was combined. This change in colour indicates that the NPs were stabilized or capped after being brought to zero valency state. To get the NPs to the proper size and form, the plant extract was crucial. Following that, the mixture was centrifuged three times for fifteen minutes at 10,000 rpm using double-distilled water.

X-ray diffraction investigation
Peaks at 38.3° (111), 64.2° (220), and 77.1° (311) were shown by the green synthesized Ag/TiO2 NPs in

, the remaining peaks are located at 25.7° (101), 48.3° (200), 54.2° (105), 55.5° (211), 63.1° (204), 70.5° (116), and 75.4° (215). These values imply an anatase tetragonal crystal structure. The Ag/TiO2 NPs' crystallite size 24 nm was determined using the Debye-Scherrer formula
, where the character D denotes the crystalline size, k is the dimensionless shape factor, λ is represents the X-ray wavelength, β indicates the broadening of the lines (FWHM), and θ is the Bragg angle

. The Ag/TiO2 NPs are vital to the arrangement of the lattice and the reactivity of the materials. It was discovered that the dislocation density (lines) for Ag/TiO2 NPs as was 8 × 1014. Ag/TiO2 NPs were found to have a microstrain value of 1.47×10−3. It increases the oxygen vacancy and promotes the cubic dopants in the monoclinic structure with the shortest crystallite diameters. Nobel metals reduced the gap between the materials and emphasized the NP surface's tetragonal anatase phase. Smallest crystallite-sized particles are preferred for use in environmental cleanup, photocatalysis, and sensors, among other applications.

Ag/TiO2 NPs displayed particles with a spherical form and a size between 20 and 30 nm. Plant chemicals aid to equally distribute the particles, and Ag metals attached Ti-OH and Osingle bondOH linkages

. Ag, Ti, O, and the remaining material peaks demonstrated how Ag/TiO2 NPs were constructed using EDX as shown in

. Furthermore, particles with spherical shapes and homogeneous distributions are more susceptible to the generation of free radicals and increased ROS production. SPR Ag metals were added to TiO2 materials to modify them and cause charge transfer, which increases the rate of deterioration. Furthermore, increased ROS production and free radical formation are exposed to particles with a spherical shape and uniform dispersion.
