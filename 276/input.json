Synthesis of CQDs
CQDs were synthesized using a hydrothermal method. 1 g of Chitosan and a 0.5 M citric acid solution were stirred at a low speed overnight until completely dissolved, yielding a homogeneous solution. The solution was transferred to a polytetrafluoroethylene reactor and processed at 180 °C for 800 min. After cooling to room temperature, a brownish-yellow solution was obtained and set aside for further use.

Synthesis of ZnO
5.95 g of hexahydrated zinc nitrate was dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water under continuous stirring. After 10 min, 1.6 g of sodium hydroxide was added, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. Subsequently, 0.5 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was added, and the solution was stirred for an additional 45 min. The resulting solution was then transferred to a polytetrafluoroethylene reactor and processed at 90 °C for 16 h. The precipitate obtained after completing the hydrothermal reaction was centrifuged, washed with water, and finally dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h to obtain a white solid.

Synthesis of different concentrations of CQD/ZnO composite
5.95 g of hexahydrated zinc nitrate was dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water under continuous stirring. After 10 min, 1.6 g of sodium hydroxide was added, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. Following this, 0.5 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide was added, and the solution was stirred for an additional 45 min. Subsequently, 5 mL and 10 mL of CQDs were separately added to two portions of the brownish solution, and stirring continued for 45 min. The resulting solutions were then transferred to polytetrafluoroethylene reactors and processed at 90 °C for 16 h. The precipitates obtained after completing the hydrothermal reaction were centrifuged, washed with water, and finally dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h to obtain light yellow solids (7.7 % CQD/ZnO and 14.3 % CQD/ZnO).

Morphology and properties of CQDs/ZnO
SEM images revealed that pure ZnO exhibited a rod-like or columnar structure (
Fig. 1
a). Upon modification with CQDs, the ZnO surface showed significant morphological changes. The nanorods in the 7.7 % CQDs/ZnO composites became more elongated (
Fig. 1
b), while an increase in CQD content to 14.3 % resulted in nanorods that appeared needle-like (
Fig. 1
c).

As depicted in
Fig. 2
a, the diffraction peaks of ZnO, 7.7 % CQDs/ZnO, and 14.3 % CQDs/ZnO exhibit similar peak intensities, presenting nine characteristic diffraction peaks. The positions of these peaks corresponded to the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO, consistent with the peak data from the hexagonal wurtzite standard card (JCPDS NO.36–1451). Specifically, the peaks corresponded to ZnO's (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (2 0 0), (1 1 2), and (2 0 1) crystal planes. This indicated that the prepared samples exhibited the standard hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO. As shown in
Fig. 2
c, the average hydrodynamic size of the nanocomposites is 615, 955, 1720 nm for ZnO, 7.7 % CQDs/ZnO and 14.3 % CQDs/ZnO. The corresponding EDX results (
Fig. S1
a) demonstrated the uniform distribution of Zn, O, and C in 7.7 % CQDs/ZnO in 7.7 % CQDs/ZnO, confirming the successful preparation of 7.7 % CQDs/ZnO.
