Preparation of HACC-NPs and DHM/HACC-NPs
HACC-NPs and DHM/HACC-NPs were prepared using the emulsification crosslinking method. Briefly, the aqueous phase was obtained by dissolving Tween-20 (6 mL) and HACC (2 g) in deionized water (120 mL). The oil phase was obtained by dissolving Span-80 (10 mL) in liquid paraffin (220 mL). The oil phase was then slowly added dropwise to the aqueous phase and emulsified using a magnetic stirrer for 30 min. The emulsified liquid was further processed with an ultrasonic cell disruptor. The sonicated liquid was allowed to cure with stirring for 40 min after cinnamaldehyde (1 mL) was added dropwise at room temperature. After the reaction, anhydrous ethanol was used for washing, and vacuum filtration was carried out after layering had occurred. The solid obtained from filtration consisted of chitosan-derivative nanoparticles (HACC nanoparticles, HACC-NPs). The HACC-NPs were suspended in deionized water, put into dialysis bags (3500 kDa), dialyzed in water for seven days at room temperature, and freeze-dried for long-term storage. The DHM/HACC-NPs were prepared in the same way as the HACC-NPs, except that 10 mL of Spectra-80 and 6 g of dihydromyricetin were dissolved in 220 mL of liquid paraffin as the oil phase.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the morphology of the synthesized NPs, which were spherical with a relatively smooth surface and a uniform distribution of particles < 200 nm in diameter (

Table 1
, the average diameters of the HACC-NPs and DHM/HACC-NPs were 102.39 ± 2.76 nm and 176.4 ± 4.32 nm, respectively, according to DLS. The PDIs of the HACC-NPs and DHM/HACC-NPs were approximately 0.23 and 0.21, respectively. The variations in the PDI observed in our study suggested that these nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed in the formulation. Interestingly, previous studies have reported that DHM/HACC-NPs have a smooth surface morphology, with a diameter of 10–200 nm and a PDI of 0–0.5 (
Xin et al., 2021
;
Zhaozhao et al., 2021
), which is consistent with our results. The zeta potential was used as a surface charge indicator of the electrokinetic potential, and values were < +30 mV for the HACC-NPs and DHM/HACC-NPs. These results further confirmed the monolithic and well-characterized uniformity and enhanced solubility of the nanoparticles afforded by HACC. A previous study showed that chitosan dihydromyricetin nanoparticles (CS-DHM-NPs) prepared using the ion crosslinking method were spherical (
Qiaohua et al., 2023
), with a particle size of 198.7 nm and zeta potential of 45.05 mV, which is similar to our results. They also proved that CS-DHM-NPs were effective at reducing cisplatin-induced kidney damage by inhibiting oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines and were more effective than free DHM. These findings motivated us to conduct ongoing in vivo tests on a mastitis model to explore the clinical potential of DHM/HACC-NPs.
