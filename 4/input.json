Synthesis of silver nanoparticles using CMC.
All glassware’s used in the experiment were cleaned well using
nitric acid and rinsed with double distilled water, followed by 
acetone for prior to use. The aqueous dispersion of silver nanoparticles
was synthesized by the chemical reduction of AgNO3 using Dglucose 
as an environmentally benign reducing agent, CMC as a
non-toxic stabilizing agent and NaOH as a base reaction catalyst.
Freshly prepared aqueous solution of CMC (0.2% [w/v], 32 ml) was
stirred for 15 min. Then, 16 ml of 1 × 10−3 M AgNO3 aqueous solution 
was added drop by drop under constant stirring. The mixture
was stirred for another 10 min to allow the diffusion of metal ions
to the stabilizing agent. After that, D-glucose (1 × 10−1 M, 480 l)
was added drop wise under continuous stirring, followed by the
addition of NaOH (2.4 ml, 1 × 10−1 M). The entire process was 
carried out at a constant temperature of 30 ± 1 ◦C and the reaction was
completed within 60 min after the first color appearance.
Characterization of CMC stabilized AgNPs. 
The CMC stabilized silver nanoparticles were roughly monitored 
by visual inspection of the reaction solution by color change
(Hebeish, El-Rafie, Abdel-Mohdy, Abdel-Halim, & Emam, 2010).
UV–vis spectra of the nanoparticles suspension was recorded on
a Shimadzu dual beam spectrophotometer (UV-1650 PC) operated
at a resolution of 1 nm at the wavelengths of 200–800 nm. The
FT-IR spectrum of nanoparticles was carried on Shimadzu FT-IR
spectrophotometer at the range between 4000- 550 cm-1(Pandey,
Goswami, & Nanda, 2012).
