 Synthesis of nio nanoparticles using red rice grains extract
Exactly, 0.1 M (2.1809 g) of Ni(NO3)2 . 6H2O was taken and dissolved in 75 mL of deionized water. Then, 25 mL of red rice grains extract was added into it. It changed the green color solution to dark red-brown, and which represented the formation of NiO nanoparticles by using red rice grains extract. The reaction mixture solution was stirred and warmed to 80 °C for 3 h. After that, it was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 30 min to obtain the precipitate. The precipitate was purified using ethanol for three times to avoid the presence of residual impurities. Later, it was dehydrated in a hot air oven at 90 °C for overnight and calcined in a muffle furnace at 460 °C for 3 h. The resultant product was ground by using mortar and pestle to make as fine nanoparticles. Then, the NiO nanoparticles were stored, and characterized by different analyzes to know their properties.
characterization
 The XRD pattern of formed NiO nanoparticles and red rice grains is given in
Fig. (3)
. The sharp, intense, strong and well-distinct diffraction peaks at 2θ = 37.25°, 43.29°, 62.90°, 75.40°, 79.40°, 79.47° and their respective lattice planes of (110),
, (111), (021), (220), (022) was observed from the
Fig. (3
a). The high crystallinity nature of NiO nanoparticles was understood from the observed diffraction pattern. The pattern was well-compatible to JCPDS card no. 89–7131, which disclosed the monoclinic end-centered crystal system formation of NiO nanoparticles with cell parameters a = 5.110 Å, b = 2.955 Å, c = 2.951 Å, α = γ = 90° and β = 125.25°. None of any other peaks were obtained, and which ascertained the formed nanoparticles were NiO. Recently, Arun et al.

 has been reported the harmonizing result of present study in biosynthesized NiO nanoparticles using leaf extract of Azadirachta indica. The noise signals were also monitored exactly at the range of 2θ = 50 – 60° and 65 – 74° and which was caused by the usage of bioactive grains extract in synthesis
[20]
. It was further verified in FTIR and EDX results. Using Scherrer's formula, the mean crystallite size was calculated and it was about 36 nm. Also, the pattern of red rice grains showed the amorphous nature. The slight appearance of peaks at 2θ = 15.16°, 18.10° and 22.95° was witnessed (

b). It was caused by the presence of carbon signal
[44]
, which reveals the presence of bioactive phytocompounds in the red rice grains.

 The HRTEM images of formed NiO nanoparticles are displayed in
Fig. (6
a-d). It revealed the polymorphism such as hexagonal, rectangular, oval and spherical shaped morphology of formed NiO nanoparticles and their size range was in between 25-50 nm. The particles were in certain structure and shape with well-defined edges. The formed nanoparticles were uniformly distributed with certain distance between them.
