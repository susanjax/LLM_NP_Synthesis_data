Synthesis of the PEG-CHO polymer
PEG-OH (1.5 g, 2 mmol), 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (0.36 g, 2.4 mmol), EDCI (0.48 g, 2.4 mmol) and DMAP (50 mg, 0.4 mmol) were added into a 20 mL of freshly dried DCM equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. After continuous stirring for 24 h at room temperature, the organic phase was collected and washed with 2 M HCl aqueous solution, saturated NaCl aqueous solution and DI water for several times and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 [
27
]. The final product was precipitated into ether/hexane for three times to afford the white powder with 86.6% yields.

Synthesis of the PEG-Schiff-Van polymer
PEG-CHO (0.36 g, 0.4 mmol), Van (0.3 g, 0.2 mmol) and DIEA (70 Î¼L, 0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of DMF solution under a nitrogen atmosphere. After refluxing for 12 h, the solvent was removed and the crude products were resolved in DCM, which was then washed with saturated NaCl aqueous solution and DI water for several times and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The final product was precipitated into ether for several times to afford the white powder with 66.4% yields.
