Green synthesis of AgNPs
Fresh leaves of SM were collected from Mettupalayam, Tamilnadu, South India. The dried leaves (10 g) were pulverized and sieved to fine powder, mixed with 100 mL of double distilled water, boiled for 30 min and filtered. Concentration of the silver nitrate solution was optimized, 1–5 mL of SM extract was added to 1–5 mM AgNO3 solution. Reaction time for the reduction varied from 0 to 5 mins and the absorbance was noted. Obvious colour change indicated the formation of AgNPs (
Fig. 1
A) and confirmed by using UV–Visible spectroscopy.

The morphological structure of SM-AgNPs was characterized using FE-SEM the particles were observed to be granular, irregular and spherical in shape as shown in
Fig. 2
. The size distribution histogram of DLS indicated that the particle corresponded 20.54 nm. The DLS histogram of green synthesized SM-AgNPs are shown in
Fig. 3
 and the size of SM-AgNPs ranged from 20 to 120 nm. The average particle size distribution of SM-AgNPs was 75.14 nm. The zeta potential of the SM-AgNPs had a prominent peak at − 19.8 mV.
