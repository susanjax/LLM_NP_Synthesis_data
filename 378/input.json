The AgNPs were synthesized by heating 95 mL of 1 mM silver nitrate with 5 mL of Nishamalaki Churna extract at 80 °C with constant stirring for 1 h. The gradual colour change of the mixture solution from yellowish orange to brownish grey indicated the completion of the synthesis, which was further confirmed by UV–visible spectroscopical investigation (JASCO V-630). On completion of the reaction, the mixture underwent a centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min, followed by washing with double distilled water, to remove the impurities.
The experimental conditions like concentration of the silver salt solution and plant extract, heating and stirring conditions, pH and reaction time were optimized by trial-and-error.

SEM analysis of green synthesized silver nanoparticles was done to get an idea about the surface morphology of nanoparticles. According to SEM images [Fig. 4], the generated silver nanoparticles were within 48–90 nm size range. The appearance of clusters could be due to the agglomeration tendency of the synthesized AgNPs.
Analyzing the X-ray powder diffraction can help identify a product's crystalline makeup. The intensity and position of peaks confirm the crystalline nature of silver nanoparticles [25,35]. Major peaks at 38.2° (111), 44.4° (200), 64.6° (220) and 77.4° (311) indicated the typical face-centered cubic structure of green synthesized silver nanoparticles [Fig. 6(b)]. The average crystallite size of formulated AgNPs, calculated by the Debye-Scherrer equation, was found to be 24.42 nm. Apart from the major peaks of silver nanoparticles, some other peaks were seen to be present at 27.9°, 32.3°, 55.4°, 67.6° which can be considered as the peaks of biogenic materials present in the extract of Nishamalaki churna.
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most serious threats to today's healthcare system. The prime factor behind increasing AMR is the formation of complex bacterial biofilms which acts as the protective shield between the bacterial cell and the antimicrobial drugs. Among various nanoformulations, green synthesized metallic silver nanoparticles are currently gaining research focus in safely breaking bacterial biofilms due to the inherent antimicrobial property of silver. In the current work, the aqueous extract of the ayurvedic formulation Nishamalaki churna is used to exhibit one pot green synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The physicochemical characteristics of Nishamalaki churna extract mediated AgNPs were evaluated using various analytical techniques, like UV–Visible spectrophotometer, FT-IR spectroscopy, SEM, XRD, DLS-Zeta potential analyzer etc. The synthesized spherical AgNPs were well formed within the size range of 30 nm to 80 nm. Furthermore, the synthesized AgNPs showed potent antibacterial effects against two primary AMR-causing bacterial species like Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with the successful destruction of their biofilm formation. Additionally, these AgNPs have shown profound antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities as desirable add-on effects required by a prospective antibacterial agent.
