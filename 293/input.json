Synthesis of bio-nanoparticle
The rhizome extract of both in vivo and ex vitro plants of K. angustifolia, in four different amounts (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 g), was added separately to 10 ml of 1.0 mM silver nitrate solution; all the experimental solutions were incubated at 45 °C temperature for 10 h under shaken condition (80 rpm). The nanoparticles synthesized were then incubated further at 28 °C for additional 10 h to obtain proper size distribution. As a result, the solutions started to turn sequentially transparent to light yellow to deep yellow to light brown and finally dark brown colour, indicating the formation of silver bio-nanoparticles. Nanoparticles were then stored in dried conditions under low temperatures

Dynamic light scattering analysis (DLS)
The total thickness of the silver bio-nanoparticles, along with the covering agent, was determined through the DLS instrument. The average size distribution of plant-mediated silver bio-nanoparticles was 36.36 nm with 100% intensity (

The actual size distribution along with the shape of the silver bio-nanoparticles was analysed by HRTEM. The size of the bio-nanoparticles ranged between 10 to 50 nm in diameter (
