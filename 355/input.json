Extract preparation
Catharanthus roseus flowers were collected from a local garden. The collected flower petals were washed with tap water and deionized water. The washed petals were dried at room temperature for 4–5 days. Then 5 g of dried petals were boiled in 200 mL of deionized water for 15 mins. Further, the boiled solution was filtered using Whatman filter paper. Afterwards the filtered extract was used for the preparation of α-Fe2O3 and Ni doped α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles.
Biosynthesis of α-Fe2O3 and Ni doped α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles
The α-Fe2O3 and Ni doped α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were synthesized by the co-precipitation method. 1.6 g of ferric chloride, FeCl3, was dissolved in 50 mL of de-ionised water, with continuous stirring for 30 min. The extract was then added dropwise into the precursor solution. Further, NaOH was added in drops to maintain pH values of 5, 7 and 12, under stirring for 15 mins. Afterwards the synthesized (settled) nanoparticles were washed with de-ionised water several times and also with ethanol under centrifugation. Then the precipitate was dried in a hot air oven for 5 hrs at 100 °C. The dried powder was ground using a pestle and mortar, calcinated for 2 hrs at 700 °C and finally α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were obtained.
The Ni doped α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were synthesized by taking 1.456 g of ferric chloride and 0.144 g of nickel chloride, which were dissolved in 50 mL of de-ionised water with continuous stirring for 30 min. The extract was then added dropwise into the precursor solution. Further, NaOH was added in drops to maintain pH values of 5, 7 and 12, under stirring for 15 mins. Afterwards the synthesized (settled) nanoparticles were washed with de-ionised water several times and also with ethanol under centrifugation. Then the precipitate was dried in a hot air oven for 5 hrs at 100 °C.

The observed XRD peaks of the synthesized nanoparticles well matched with JCPDS card no (00–033-0664), indicating a rhombohedral hematite structure (R-3c space group) for α-Fe2O3. The high intensity (104) plane represents the crystalline nature of the α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles. The detected peaks of the nickel doped α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were similar to those of the α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles. The doping concentration of nickel showed the intensity of the diffracted peak (104) gradually decreased, whilst the full width half maximum increased. This suggests that the doping of Ni ions constitutes the nucleation centers of the α-Fe2O3 matrix without a change in the rhombohedral structure, but the broadening of the peak represents the affect on the crystallite size [16].
