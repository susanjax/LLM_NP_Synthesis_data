 Preparation of aqueous extract (cold method)
In 50 ml of distilled water, 15 g of dried leaves were added, heated 1 hr in water bath at 60 Â°C, further the extract was filtered to get a clear extract. For next studies the final filtration was stored in a cool dry place (
Poornima et al., 2019
,
Thilagam et al., 2013
).

2.4. Preparation of zinc acetate solution for synthesis of ZnO NPs
0.1 M of Zinc acetate (Zn(O2CCH3)2(H2O)2) was prepared using distilled water, 18.348 g of Zinc acetate in 1000 ml of distilled water (183.48 g/L).

2.5. Synthesis of ZnO NPs
50 ml of 0.1 M (Zn(O2CCH3)2(H2O)2) solution was added to 20 ml of plant extract under constant stirring and heating, the process was continued till 1 hr to get zinc hydroxide, after the process, mixture becomes yellowish-cream color precipitate (
Dolcet et al., 2012

).

 This is a prevalent methodology for evaluating the crystalline nature and configuration of solid specimens. B. orellana XRD pattern was studied, which revealed a Bragg reflection with X values of 2.

 indicate ZnO NPs presence in the sample. The XRD patterns of the nanoparticles reveal information about the phases, structures, and crystalline (sharp peaks) orientations of the particles. Spectra of diffraction at 31.830, 34.480, 36.310, 47.400, 56.650, 62.910, 66.430, 68.000, and 69.140. They were connected to the lattice in a series of planes: (100, 002, 101, 102, 110, 103, 200, 112 and 201) (

).
Using Debye-Scherrer equation:
, the nanoparticles size was measured..

The crystalline size of the generated nanoparticle ranges from 76.92 nm up to 84.41 nm. The NPs average crystalline size was measured as 82.66 nm.
