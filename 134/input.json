Synthesis of GO and rGO
GO was produced by oxidising and exfoliating bulk graphite using a standard modified Hummers’ method according to the procedure by Dubey et al. [46] Briefly, the mixture was prepared by mixing graphite flakes (3 g), concentrated sulphuric acid (70 mL), and sodium nitrate (1.5 g), and the mixture continuously stirred in an ice bath at <4 °C for 30 min. Potassium permanganate (9 g) was slowly added to the mixture, which was then stirred for 24 h to fully oxidise the graphite. The resulting mixture was diluted with MilliQ water (400 mL) to which 30% hydrogen peroxide (18 mL) was then added; a colour change from brown to yellow confirming graphite oxidation. GO was purified by six cycles of washing with 1 M HCl (20 mL total) followed by MilliQ water (1 L total) and centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted after each round of centrifugation and continued washing with MilliQ water until the supernatant became neutral. GO powder was obtained by vacuum drying of the final centrifuged solid at 80 °C for 10 h. Reduced GO was produced by mixing GO (1 g) with MilliQ water (125 mL) and 4 h ultrasonication to obtain a homogeneous GO suspension (8 mg/mL). This suspension was then magnetically stirred at 150 rpm for 15 min, to which 0.8 mM sodium borohydride (4 mL) was added drop wise as a reductant and stirring continued at 60 °C for 2 h. The suspension was repeatedly centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min, with the supernatant decanted and solid product washed with MilliQ water (500 mL) each time to remove unreacted reductant. rGO powder was obtained by vacuum drying of the final centrifuged solid at 80 °C for 6 h.

Synthesis of ZnO
0.2 M sodium hydroxide (50 mL) was added to a 0.1 M aqueous zinc sulphate heptahydrate solution (50 mL) and the resulting mixture magnetically stirred at 150 rpm for 15 min and then heated at 60 °C for 2 h. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant decanted, and resulting solid product washed with MilliQ water (1 L total) prior to another five cycles of washing, decanting of supernatant and centrifugation. ZnO NPs were obtained by vacuum drying of the final centrifuged solid at 80 °C for 6 h
Characterisation
Bulk and textural properties of pure GO and ZnO components, and the ZnO-rGO composite were first characterised by electron microscopy, powder XRD and nitrogen porosimetry. TEM and SEM reveals that the GO comprised micron-scale wrinkled sheets of a few nm thickness (Fig. 2a and Fig. S1), characteristic of GO produced by the exfoliation, and subsequent oxidation, of hydrophobic graphite multilayers in aqueous media [50]. ZnO was prepared as large (50–300 nm across), irregular aggregates of smaller nanoparticles. The ZnO-rGO nanocomposite appeared an intimate mixture of the two components, albeit exhibiting smaller sheet-like fragments (attributable to rGO), decorated by higher contrast and uniformly distributed ZnO nanoparticles and their aggregates. Specific surface areas of rGO and ZnO were 8 m2/g and 24 m2/g respectively, and that of the nanocomposite 12 m2/g (Table S1), lower than the (scant) literature reports for related ZnO-rGO photocatalysts which range from 41 to 150 m2/g [[51], [52], [53]]. Note that freeze-drying did not change textural properties of the nanocomposite (Fig. S2 and Table S1), consistent with previous reports [54]. Powder XRD confirmed the successful synthesis of nanoparticulate ZnO and GO nanosheets (Fig. 2b), with corresponding volume-averaged particle sizes of 13 nm and 17 nm respectively. Reflections at 2θ = 31.82° (100), 34.37° (002), 36.25° (101), 47.54° (102), 56.58° (110), 62.83° (103), 67.92° (200), 69.14° (112), 69.20° (201), 72.85° (004), 77.24° (202) are consistent with a hexagonal wutrize ZnO phase [55]. The parent GO sample exhibits a sharp reflection at 10.3°, characteristic of (001) planes for GO sheets and corresponding to an interplanar spacing of ∼0.8 nm [56], and a weaker, broader peak ∼20–25° arising from trace residual graphite. The intensity of the (001) GO reflection is significantly weaker in the ZnO-rGO nanocomposite, and slightly shifted to higher angle (10.7°); this shift is attributed to strong π–π stacking interaction between electron-deficient GO and π-electron-rich rGO sheets [57]. The composite also exhibits several reflections >27° characteristic of hexagonal ZnO (JCPDS: 036–1451), and a small but well-defined peak at ∼25° indicative of the (002) reflection of rGO and consistent with the 0.4 nm interlayer spacing of graphene [58].
