Synthesis of silver nanoparticles
Silver nanoparticles were synthesized by using the microwave-assisted green synthesis method. The soluble starch was used as a base polymer. The purpose of using soluble starch was to provide stabilization and hinder the agglomeration of Ag NPs. First of all, 0.5 % (wt/v) starch solution was prepared, and following that, 1 M AgNO3 was added. The obtained solution was stirred for 15 min. After continuously stirring, the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 8.5 by using NaOH solution. The pH adjusted solution was left stirring for 15 min, and this solution was put into a domestic microwave oven operating at 180 W for one hour nanoparticles

. The obtained solution was dried in an oven at 120 Â°C for 30 min
