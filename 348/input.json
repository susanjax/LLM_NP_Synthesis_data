 Synthesis and characterization of silver nanoparticles
The method for silver nanoparticles preparation using gum kondagogu was standardized and earlier reported by us. The silver nanoparticles were synthesized by autoclaving 0.5% homogenous gum solution prepared from 38 μm sized gum powder, containing 1 mM silver nitrate at 121 °C and15 psi for 60 min (Kora et al., 2010). The UV–visible absorption spectrum (UV–vis) of the prepared nanoparticle solution was recorded using an Elico SL 196 spectrophotometer (Hyderabad, India), from 250 to 800 nm, against corresponding gum blank. The shape of the nanoparticles was obtained with a NT-MDT Solver PRO-EC atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Zelenograd, Russia) operating in tapping mode. A minimum of 100 particles were counted and the size distribution and average particle size was obtained using OriginPro 7.0 software. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted with a Rigaku, Ultima IV diffractometer (Tokyo, Japan) using monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) running at 40 kV and 30 mA. The intensity data for the nanoparticle solution deposited on a glass slide was collected over a 2θ range of 35–70° with a scan rate of 1°/min. The zeta potential of the nanoparticle solution was assessed with a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern, UK).

After autoclaving, the appearance of yellow color in the reaction mixture indicated the formation of silver nanoparticles by the gum, a dual functional reductant and stabilizer. In the UV–vis spectrum a single strong peak with a maximum at 408 nm was observed, which corresponds to the typical surface plasmon resonance of silver nanoparticles [Fig. 1(a)]. From the AFM image, it was found that the nanoparticles are spherical in shape, polydisperse and the average particle size was about 4.5 ± 3.1 nm [Fig. 1(b)]. The XRD pattern of the silver showed characteristic diffraction peaks at 38.2°, 44.2° and 64.4°, respectively, corresponding to (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) planes of face centred cubic (fcc) crystal structure of metallic silver. In addition, the broadening of the diffraction peaks suggested the effect of nano-sized particles [Fig. 1(c)]. The highly stable nature of the produced colloids was also confirmed from the measured zeta potential value of −32.7 ± 3.8 mV [Fig. 1(d)].
