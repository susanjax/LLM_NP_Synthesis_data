Green synthetic approach to the AuNP-CC
Fresh Citrus limon was obtained from local market of Jeddah city, Saudi Arabia. After proper washing, they were cut into halves. The halves were subjected to mechanical press where its juice was extracted. The juice was filtered to separate the pulp particles from it. The juice was slightly heated to temperature not exceeding than 80 °C. This way the juice was concentrated and stored for further use in the synthesis of the metal nanoparticles.
Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized using Citrus limon fruit extract by using HAuCl4 salt aqueous solutions. Briefly, a cotton cloth (CC) was washed with a detergent using warm water followed by rinsing with deionized water. The CC was dipped in a 0.32 mM HAuCl4 aqueous solution for 10 min at room temperature. Then 2 mL of extract was added to this system and solution was left at stirring. The CC was incubated in an Au salt + extract mixed solution for 2 h at 30 °C. An visual change in color indicated the formation of the AuNPs on the CC. The AuNPs coated CC (AuNPs-CC) was removed from the precursor solution, washed with deionized water and lastly dried in the vacuum oven. The samples were stored for further experiments.
