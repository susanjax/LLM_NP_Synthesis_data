Synthesis and characterization of GNPs
Microwave mediated green synthesis of GNPs were performed by utilizing aqueous extract of A. philippense (AE) and physicochemical characterizations were done as per established methods in our laboratory [27], [28]. Briefly, leaves were washed twice with tap water and double distilled water (dd.H2O) respectively, shade dried in dust free condition, grinded into fine powder followed by extraction in dd.H2O at a concentration of 1 g per 50 ml after 72 h of shaking incubation at 25 °C. The final filtered aqueous extract (AE) was employed for the synthesis of GNPs. Different volumetric concentration (1–10%) of AE was mixed with 1 mM fixed concentration of HAuCl4 aqueous solution and the resultant mixture solution was subjected to microwave irradiation in a domestic microwave oven (900 W, 2.45 GHz, LG MO- MC-767 W/WS). 5 ml of final reaction volume was maintained in all experiments. Reactions were stopped at the change of original yellowish colour into different hues of red colour. Time was noted for each applied concentration of AE. Qualitative tests for different phytochemicals (terpenoids, alkaloids and flavonoids) of the plant extract and the synthesized GNPs were also performed according to well established protocols [29].
characterization of GNPs
Furthermore, the morphology and size of the GNPs were characterized using TEM analysis, which revealed a mixed population of spherical and triangular shaped GNPs of various sizes (Fig. 1A). Selected-area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) and ultra-high resolution TEM (UHRTEM) analysis of a single spherical particle confirmed its crystalline nature (Fig. 1B, C). A histogram representing the size distribution (Fig. 1D) of GNPs corresponding to TEM image revealed the average particle size to be around 33.9 ± 14.0 nm. FESEM-EDX result confirmed the synthesis of GNPs (Fig. S3). XRD patterns of GNPs exhibited four prominent Bragg reflections with 2θ values at around 38.4°, 44.5°, 64.7° and 78.01° of lattice planes and were indexed to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) facets of gold respectively (Fig. S3). Characteristic FTIR bands of AE showed presence of hydroxyl (–OH), alkanes, aliphatic amines and aromatic amines, Cdouble bondC (benzene origin) and carbonyl functional groups (Fig. S4, curve A). Almost all IR bands present in AE were also observed in the GNPs sample with a considerable shift in transmittance level (Fig. S4, curve B).
