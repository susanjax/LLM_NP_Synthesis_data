Synthesis of silver nanoparticles
Silver nitrate (AgNO3) of analytical grade (AR) was purchased from Merck. About 10 ml of the aqueous extract of S. varians was added into 90 ml of aqueous solution of 1 mM Silver nitrate AgNO3. The mixture was exposed to a range of controlled temperatures for 20 min. Appearance of red color in solution indicated the formation of SNPs. The solution was then kept in dark for further analysis.

The sample of SNPs could be also characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis of dry powders. The diffracted intensities were recorded from 10° to 80° at 2 theta angles (
Fig. 2
). Four different and important characteristic peaks were observed at the 2θ of 38.1°, 44.3°, 64.5°, and 76.4° that correspond to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) planes, respectively. All the peaks in XRD pattern can be readily indexed to a face-centered cubic structure of silver as per available literature (JCPDS, File No. 4-0783). The average crystal size of the silver crystallites was calculated from the FWHMs of the diffraction peaks, using the Scherrer equation. The size of the crystallite in different planes of silver was determined as 23.5, 20.3, 14.4, and 12.2 nm with the mean value of all peaks as 17.6 nm. The broadening of the Bragg peaks indicates the reduction in grain size.

Scanning electron microscopy has provided further insight into the morphology and size details of the synthesized nanoparticles.
Fig. 3
 shows the SEM image of SNPs. It seems that the sample consisted of a large quantity of dispersive nanoparticles with the average size of about 35 nm. As it is clear in the SEM image, the nanoparticles are relatively uniform and seemed as quasi-spheres.
