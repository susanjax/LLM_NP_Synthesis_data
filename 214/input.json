Synthesis of CoFe2O4 and CoMnFe2O4
For synthesis of CoFe2O4 (CF), CoMnFe2O4 (CFM), CoFe2O4 @S.C (SCF) & CoMnFe2O4 @S.C (SCFM), stochiometric amounts 5 mmol of CoCl2·6 H2O (0.284 g) and 10 mmol FeCl3·6 H2O (0.378 g) were dissolved in 13 mL of deionized water. To this sodium acetate (3.05 g) and urea (0.6 g) were added until complete dissolution. Afterward, 117 mLof n-heptane was added and contents were then transferred to a 200 mL, stainless steel autoclave with Teflon lining for hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C for 4 h. Black powder CoFe2O4 nanoparticles after washing, were dried and calcined at 450 °C for 2 h. For CoMnFe2O4 stochiometric ratio of chemicals was 5 mmol of CoCl2.6 H2O, 6 mmol of FeCl3.6 H2O and 4 mmol of MnCl2.2 H2O were used. Etanolic extract (15 mL) from 2 g of Swertia Chirata (S.C.) was used for synthesis of S.C. mediated CoFe2O4 and CoMnFe2O4 with similar procedure as adopted above only n-heptane used was 98 mL.

characterization
DLS measurements were carried out to estimate the hydrodynamic size of CFNPs and interparticle aggregation in solution. DLS studies showed average size (48–91.5 nm) of cobalt ferrit NPs (
Fig. 2
). CoFe2O4 @S.C (SCF) & CoMnFe2O4 @S.C (SCFM) showed size (51 nm, 48 nm) comparatively lesser than CoFe2O4 (CF) and CoMnFe2O4 (CFM) (90 nm, 78 nm) as former are the plant mediated. Usually, nanoparticle with size less than 100 nm are important for biological application. Besides, synthesized nanoparticle also shown hydrodynamic size value greater than minimum threshold value of 5 nm, as recommended for in vivo applications
[33]
. The average size of CF NPs obtained from DLS are different from SEM due to solvation properties of DSL. Size determined by DLS is two to three time larger than orginal size due to dispersion of nanoparticles in water. As dipole moment of water is higher, it therefore resulted in stronger interaction between solvent molecule and particle surface. The change in size due to solvation may be 50–100 nm

The morphology of synthesized NPs was observed in FESEM. The image of particle in
Fig. 3
A, B at 1 µm and 500 nm scale is given. FESEM images show the formation of nanocrystalline particle having nearly spherical nature and big agglomerates
Fig. 3
B. This agglomeration occurs due to dipole-dipole interaction in magnetic particles. The morphology revealed that some parts were agglomerated, some were spherical, and some particles were separated from one another
[35]
. This irregularity in morphology may be caused by post-calcination treatment since it accelerated the coalescence process and increased the average size of the nanoparticles. Moreover, small-sized nanoparticle surfaces were also melted and aggregated to generate larger nanoparticles
[36]
. Ambiguity in size also appeared with some very small particles with smaller crystallite size less than 100 nm and some larger aggregated clusters with size from (120–157 nm)
[37]
. Agglomeration is observed to be increase in (SCFM), due to Mn doping of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles and particle size approximately 45–50 nm. Magnetization of CF is less than CFM due to increase in attractive forces and hence agglomeration increased.
