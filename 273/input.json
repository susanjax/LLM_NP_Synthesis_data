Inorganic support synthesis
MCM41-type mesoporous silica nanoparticles were synthesized according to the procedure previously described (
Manzano and Vallet-Regí, 2019
,
Candel et al., 2012
). 1, 2 N-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr, 1.00 g, 2.74 mmol) was first dissolved in 480 mL of deionized water. Then 3.5 mL of an aqueous solution of NaOH 2.00 M was added, and the tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, 5 mL, 2.57 × 10−2 mol) was then added dropwise to the surfactant solution. The mixture was stirred for 2 h to produce a white precipitate. Finally, the solid product was centrifuged, washed with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C. To prepare the final porous material, the as-synthesized solid was calcined at 550 °C, using an oxidant atmosphere for 5 h to remove the template phase. The final MCM-41 silica nanoparticles, bare and unloaded (MSNs), were obtained after this procedure.

In addition, TEM analysis of the different prepared solids was performed. TEM images also confirm the preservation of the mesoporous structure in the final MSNs-Cur-PMB solid. The images show that the initial (

a) and final MSNs (

b-c) exhibit the same morphology, concluding that the spherical shape and mesoporous nature of the inorganic matrix remain after the loading and functionalization processes. Furthermore, a mapping of the atomic composition of MSNs-Cur-PMB (

d; d-i; d-ii; d-iii) by scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX) shows the presence of N atoms on the MSNs surface (along with Si and O), which is attributed to proper functionalization with PMB.
