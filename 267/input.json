100 ml of AgNO3 (molar mass 169.87 g·mol−1, odorless, density 4.35 g/cm3, boiling point 440 °C) with concentrations of 0.5, 1, 3 and 10 m molar added to a 3, 5, 10, 15 and 30 mL of aqueous extract. This solution was placed on the shaker at certain temperatures and contact time with a round of 150 rad. The creating of brown and opaque color in the solution will indicate the formation of silver nanoparticles. For evaluation the concentration of AgNo3, of this solution was added concentrations of (0.5, 1, 3 and 10) mM to the aqueous extract of Berberis vulgaris that this solution was placed on a shaker at room temperature for 1 h. To evaluate the effect of value of aqueous extract, the AgNo3 solution with concentration of 3 mM was added into volumes of (3, 5, 10, 15 and 30) mL of aqueous extract that this solution was put up on a shaker at room temperature for 1 h. To investigate the reaction time, 3 mM of AgNo3 was added into 5 mL of the aqueous extract plant and placed on a shaker at ambient temperature for (1, 2, 6, 12 and 24) h. Finally, the absorption spectra of samples were taken at 200–800 nm [

The TEM analysis of silver nanoparticles in optimal conditions is presented in (
Fig. 6
). The TEM image of synthesized silver nanoparticles shows that which the particles are nanoscale and uniformity. Also
Fig. 6
 shows the shape and size of the produced nanoparticles using the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which has silver nanoparticles spherical forms and the size ranges of 30 to 70 nm. These findings are also confirmed by other researchers [
