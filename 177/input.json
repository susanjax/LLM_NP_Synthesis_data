CuS:Co NPs synthesizing procedure
2.1. CuS:Co NPs synthesizing procedure
In 140 mL water and 10 mL liquid NH3, 0.1 M CuCl2·6H2O and Na2S were liquefied. After 1 h of vigorous stirring, blue coloured precipitates were discovered after 4 h of age, which was filtered and calcined at 400 °C for 1 h. After calcination, the resultant product was crushed to get CuS NPs, labelled as U0. To achieve Co doping, CoCl2·2H2O with 5, 10 and 15 wt% of the weight of copper(II) chloride was dissolved in CuS precursor solution and the above procedure was repeated to get CuS:Co NPs which were labelled as U1, U2 and U3.

2.2. Chitosan-loaded CuS:Co NPs synthesis
Copper (II) chloride, sodium sulphide (0.1 M), 10% CoCl2·2H2O (optimal value), and 2% chitosan (2.55 gm) were dissolved in 150 mL water, agitated and aged for 4 h. Filtering, washing, calcining at 400 °C for 1 h, and crushing the precipitates yielded chitosan-loaded CuS:Co NPs.

Characterization
Fig. 1
(a–d) shows the diffraction patterns of CuS:Co NPs. JCPDS Card No. 06-0464 confirms polycrystalline nature with hexagonal diffraction peaks. According to the definition provided by crystal growth kinetics, a crystal can have a polycrystalline structure while yet exhibiting a wide variety of orientations and grain sizes. These characteristics will govern its behaviour in the overall crystal development, defining the polycrystalline structure. In the case of different orientations, neighbouring crystals compete for growth. This competing growth causes a change in texture and shape. The hexagonal phase dominated the growth texture in this situation [
17
]. No peaks resembled other phases or contaminants. This lends credence to the hypothesis that Co replace Cu in the hexagonal lattice, or that Co segregates to non-crystalline regions close to grain boundaries. According to Mohamed et al. [
18
], this is true for Fe-doped TiO2 nanostructures. The locations of the XRD peaks move towards higher 2θ values with Co doping as its ionic radius (0.58 Å) is less than Cu2+ (0.65 Å) ions.

TEM image of pure CuS confirmed the agglomeration of nanosized grains (
Fig. 4
(a)). Spherical shaped grains seem to be embedded in bulky patches for the U1 sample. (
Fig. 4
(b)). The U2 sample displays nanosized grains and a small number of nanorods (
Fig. 4
(c)). Clustered nanograins along with few hexagons are visible for the U3 sample (
Fig. 4
(d)).
