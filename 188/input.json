. In brief, 100 mg of tungsten chloride salt was dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol by 2 min of sonication and 100 mg of NaBH4 was dissolved in 10 mL of double distilled water. Then the aqueous sodium borohydride was added drop wise slowly to the ethanolic solution of tungsten(VI) chloride and stirred vigorously at the temperature at 78 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent the formation of tungsten oxide. The dark violet-blue color of the solution turning to pale yellow indicates the formation of tungsten nanoparticles. Then organic mixture containing 100 mg of phase transfer agent (PHA) tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB) and 100 mg of VNTE was added and stirred vigorously to get a homogeneous solution. Then the organic mixture is added to an aqueous solution and stirred vigorously for 6 h at room temperature. The color change of the organic phase from green to dark yellow indicates the formation of VNTE-WNPs. After the completion of the reaction, the organic phase was carefully separated and washed with double distilled water four times and reduced to 20 percent in the rotator evaporator. Then the reduced mixture was stored in room temperature for 24 h and mixed with di-ethyl-ether. Solid dark yellow color VNTE-WNPs obtained was used for further characterization and applications. The schematic representation of synthesis of VNTE-WNPs was shown in

Characterization of VNTE-WNPs
The X-ray diffractogram of the VNTE-WNPs is shown in 
Fig. 6
. All thewell-defined diffraction peaks 2θ = 40.3° (110), 58.2° (200) and 73.5° (210) show the presence of tungsten metal nanoparticles with body centered cubic (bcc) structure, which is well matched with JCPDS card no. 4–0728. The average crystallite size of the sample was calculated by Scherrer's equation D = 0.94λ/βcosθ and the calculated mean crystallite size is 35 nm and it is closer to the TEM result. Absence of diffraction peak (011), (111), (121) and (112) confirms that the synthesized compound has no metal oxides
