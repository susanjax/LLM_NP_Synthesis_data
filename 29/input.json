Synthesis of silver nanoparticles
The actinobacterial S. xinghaiensis OF1 strain, was cultured in Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of halophilic nutrient broth (pH 8.5) and incubated in the orbital shaker (150 r.p.m.) at 27 ± 1 °C for one week. The cell biomass was harvested by centrifugation at 6000×g for 10 min and washed thrice with sterile distilled water to remove the attached media components. The cell biomass was re-suspended in 100 ml sterile distilled water, incubated at 27 ± 1 °C for 48 h and then separated by centrifugation 6000×g for 10 min. Supernatant was filtered by 0.45 µm cellulose filter, combined with AgNO3 solution (final concentration 0.001 mol l−1) and incubated at room temperature for 2–3 days. The cell free supernatant without silver nitrate was used as control.
Characterization of AgNPs
The dark-brown colour of the cell filtrate of strain OF1 after treatment with 1 mM aqueous solution of AgNO3 was observed, which confirmed the synthesis of AgNPs. Further, the synthesized AgNPs were characterized by UV–Vis spectroscopy, which revealed narrow peak with a maximum absorbance at 420 nm (Fig. 1).
TEM analysis of AgNPs synthesized from S. xinghaiensis OF1 strain revealed the presence of spherical and polydispersed nanoparticles in the size range of 5–20 nm. At some places the aggregation of nanoparticles were also observed (Fig. 2). In the present experiment, the nanaoparticle tracking analysis revealed average size of biosynthesized AgNPs of 64 (± 49) nm and their concentration as 2.7 × 107 particles ml−1 (Fig. 3). The FTIR analysis of AgNPs synthesized from strain OF1 showed total five absorbance bands at 3432, 2925, 1631, 1385 and 1033 cm−1 (Fig. 4).
