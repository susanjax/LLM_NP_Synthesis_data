Synthesis of silk sericin-capped silver nanoparticles
Aqueous silver nitrate solution was prepared for AgNP synthesis. The lyophilized silk sericin was placed in a conical flask containing an aqueous AgNO3 solution. Two molar ratios of SS to AgNO3 were used: 1:6 and 1:8. The silver ions were reduced to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) within a few minutes at 65°C with continuous stirring. The color of the solution changed from yellow to brown. The SS-AgNPs synthesized using different molar ratios were characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy, FTIR-ATR spectroscopy, XRD, and TEM measurements.

TEM was conducted to determine the size and shape of nanoparticles.
Figure 3
a–e shows the TEM image of the 1:6 SS-AgNPs and 1:8 SS-AgNPs, respectively. It was observed from the images that the synthesized SS-AgNPs at both the 1:6 and 1:8 mole ratios dispersed well in the aqueous solution. Most of the synthesized SS-AgNPs were clearly observed in the size range of 5–25 nm in

b, e. The average particle size of the 1:6 SS-AgNPs was 10–30 nm and that of the 1:8 SS-AgNPs was 5–20 nm. The high resolution of TEM images showed the lattice structure of AgNPs with a range of 0.25 nm, which was indicated by the face-centered cubic crystalline structure of the metallic AgNP plane of cubic silver [

 shows the crystalline structure of SS, AgNO3, and SS-AgNPs obtained using XRD (

). The XRD spectrum of SS, AgNO3, and SS-AgNPs has shown the characteristic patterns of the different crystalline structures, which are summarized in

. The value of 2θ at 14.9° and 19.2° could be related to the crystalline and amorphous organic phase of SS. Silver nitrate showed a cubic phase of Ag2O crystal and a face-centered cubic crystalline structure of metallic Ag. It was detected at 29.5°, 32.3°, 44.3°, and 48.8°, which corresponds to the (98), (200), (200), and (200) plane of cubic silver and 38.4° and 38.8° indicated (111), (111), the face-centered cubic crystalline structure of metallic Ag.
