Synthesis of ZnO NPs
ZnO NPs were synthesized based on the sol-gel technique. 2 g of zinc chloride was dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water, and 10 g of sodium hydroxide was dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water on a magnetic stirrer for 20 min. Next, the mixture of zinc chloride and sodium hydroxide solution was titrated in a beaker containing 100 mL of ethanol for 30 min, and finally, a white precipitate was formed. The sediment formed was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min to separate the impurities. In addition, it was washed with ethanol to ensure getting rid of any unreacted particles. The formed powder was dried overnight at 60 °C and stored for future studies.
X-ray Diffraction analysis was performed to study the crystal structure and formation of ZnO NPs in the desired hydrogel. As shown in Fig. 2b, the spectrum of SA has a broad peak around 20° = 2θ indicating an amorphous structure with no distinct crystal planes or phases. The spectrum of ZnO NPs has several sharp peaks corresponding to the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO with lattice parameters a = 3.249 Å and c = 5.206 Å. The spectrum of SA/ZnO hydrogel has similar peaks as ZnO NPs but with lower intensities due to the presence of SA matrix. The peaks are labeled with Miller indices such as (100), (002), and (110) indicating the orientation of the crystal planes relative to the axes of the unit cell [27].
Fig. 2c shows a cluster of ZnO NPs synthesized using zinc chloride as a precursor by the sol-gel method. ZnO NPs have a spherical shape and high density, which may indicate good crystallinity and stability of the material. Also, these nanoparticles have a light gray color, which may indicate a wide band gap and high transparency in the visible range [28].
