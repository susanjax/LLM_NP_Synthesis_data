Synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles
ZnO nanoparticles were prepared by refluxing precursor zinc acetate dihydrate (0.1 M) in diethylene glycol and triethylene glycol at 180 °C and 220 °C respectively. Reaction time varied for 2 and 3 h with and without sodium acetate (0.01 M). Before refluxing, the solution was kept on a magnetic stirrer at 80 °C for 1.5 h. After completion of reflux action, the samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min and washed with distilled water and ethanol for three times. Further, it was dried at 80 °C for overnight (

 A and B represents diffractograms of ZnO NPS.The XRD of all the samples having 2θ values with reflection planes at 31.72° (100), 34.39° (002), 36.23° (101) and 47.44° (102) corresponds to JCPDS Card No. 36-1451. So,all diffraction peaks fit well with hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO, which proves that ZnO was successfully synthesized by polyol hydrolysis method

 clearly shows that the zinc oxide nanoparticles obtained by refluxing diethylene glycol and triethylene glycol for 2 h and 3 h in presence and in absence of sodium acetate have uniform shape and size with different morphology. Image depicts addition of sodium acetate, use of different polyol and change in reflux time from 2 h to 3 h offers difference in morphology from oval to rod shape with average particle size of ~ 15 to 100 nm. FESEM and TEM analysis reports DEG refluxed for 3 h in absence of sodium acetate exhibited least particle size of ~ 15 nm.
