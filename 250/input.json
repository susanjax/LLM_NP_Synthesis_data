 Biosynthesis of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles using M. koenigii leaf extract
 Biosynthesis and stabilization of NiFe O NPs using M. koenigii aqueous extract was initiated using NiCl and FeCl with 4.0 mM each in a 250 mL flask. Initially, 150 mL M. koenigii extract solution was heated at 95 °C, followed by adding NiCl solution slowly under vigorous stirring and then reaction was carried out in the dark for 2 h. The color of reaction solution was changed from brownish to a blackish suspension. Thereafter, the FeCl solution was added slowly with maintaining the preceding reaction temperature and then further adding 100 mL of M. koenigii extract in ongoing reaction suspension for 2 h. Consequently, the reaction suspension was cool down and, continual addition of 1.0 M NaOH solution to the acidic reaction suspension until it reached to pH∼10. As a result, precipitant solution was obtained and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (Eppendorf AG 22331 Hamburg, Model No. 5452, Germany). The precipitate was washed multiple times with double distilled water and three times with methanol. Resulted washed precipitate was dried overnight at 90 °C. The dried product was crushed and made into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. The powder was calcined at 400 °C for 2 h. The calcined powder of NiFe O NPs was obtained and characterized by various techniques. The schematic workflow is shown in Fig. 1(b).

 Biosynthesized NiFe O NPs crystallite size, microstrain, and dislocation density were investigated by XRD spectroscopy. The diffraction pattern was recorded in the range of 10°– 80°, as shown in Fig.5(a). Major peaks of NiFe O NPs in XRD spectrum are indexed as (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), (440) and (533) at 30.27, 35.70, 38.86, 43.40, 54.94, 57.75, 63.02, 74.48° Bragg reflection angle. Further, obtained XRD peaks are fully matched with the standard card [JCPDS # 10-0325] of the NiFe O [41]. XRD data of biosynthesized NiFe O NPs attribute that the prepared material is nanostructured as related to cubic (Space Group Fd3m) shape and well stabilized and dispersed by M. koenigii phytochemicals. The lattice parameters of biosynthesized NiFe O NPs were determined using Eqs. (2), (3), (4)). For the diffraction plan at (400), atomic distance (d) was calculated as d (Å)=2.0941 and noticed to be a (Å)=8.3764±0.03 and V=587.722±0.5. Nevertheless, these parameters confirm the cubic structure of the synthesized nanostructures and are well agreed with standard data [JCPDS # 10-0325]
 TEM and SEM analyzed the biosynthesized NiFe O NPs surface morphology and particle size distribution. Fig. 6(a) displays the TEM image of the NiFe2O4 NPs, which are spherical in shape. Fig. 6(b) shows the selected area electron transmission diffraction (SAED) pattern of NiFe O NPs, which refers to the crystallinity as a cubic spinel crystal structure.
