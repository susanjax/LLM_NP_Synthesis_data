Preparation of Ephedra-extract and biosynthesis of Ephedra-AuNPs
A High class of Ephedra was purchased from a standard spices store and ethanol was acquired from Sigma Aldrich. Ephedra was washed for several times very well to remove the impurities and dust particles before use. Then 50 mL of distilled water followed by 20 mL of ethanol was added to 5 g of Ephedra, and mixed it well. To attain the composition of Ephedra-AuNPs, 4 mL of Ephedra-extract was added to 6 mL of Au. The solution mixture was stirred nearly an hour until the solution turns to the sapphire color. Afterward, the
 ions were reduced to
 due to the existence of antioxidants in the Ephedra-extract results in the formation of Ephedra-AuNPs which further confirmed by observing the characteristic ruby red color of the solution.

The Ephedra-extract of 1 mL to 4 mL with 6 mL of
 reactions was scrutinized for 3 h at RT. The UV–vis. spectra recorded that showed the SPR peak at 549 nm enhanced and become sharper with increase in 1 mL to 4 mL volume of Ephedra-extract (
Fig. 1
).
The Ephedra-AuNPs were synthesized separately at different temperatures i.e at15 °C, 20 °C, and 25 °C 30 °C, 35 °C and observed the UV–vis. absorption spectra. The reaction at 15 °C obtained a broad peak at 440 nm which upon increasing the reaction temperature started forming a prominent sharp peak at 540 nm at 20 °C that further increases its intensity at 25 °C. When increasing the temperatures again up to 30 °C and 35 °C the Absorbance of the peak decreased Comparing with the previous results, suggested the optimum reaction temperature at 25 °C (
Fig. 4
).
The Ephedra-AuNPs reaction was performed in the range of pH levels 1–7 along with the above optimized conditions with regular UV–vis. monitoring. The 540 nm peak was observed, where the pH from 1 to 4 the peak intensity was increased. At pH 5 a broad peak formed and continued broadening up to pH 7 along with the decrease in the peak intensity was obtained (
Fig. 5
). Where, the optimum pH is found to be at pH 4 and is corroborated by TEM images which further confirmed their small size and homogeneous shape as well (
Fig. 8
 (A)).

The HRTEM (50 nm scale) analysis and size distribution histogram (20 nm scale) and HAADF-STEM studies of the Ephedra-AuNPs confirmed the presence of 1.3 nm to 15.6 nm spherical and triangle morphologies (
Fig. 8
 (A-C)). The constructed AuNPs obtained −19.6 mV of average zeta potential in a single sharp peak further explored its size and stability, and are not agglomerated (
Fig. 8
 (D)). The current outcomes are carefully compared, and are consistent to the former reports of AuNPs.
