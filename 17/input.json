Synthesis of nanoparticles
About 200 mL of mycelia-free fungal cultural filtrate containing 0.1 M precursor salt AgNO3 was taken in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The flask was incubated in a dark condition at 28°C on a shaker at 150 rpm for 96 hours. Positive control (culture filtrate without silver salt) and negative control (only AgNO3 solution) were also run along with the experimental flasks, following the method of Bhainsa and D’Souza.8

Characterization of the NPs.
XRD and Debye–Scherrer analysis of the drop-coated film of dried sample (reaction mixture) revealed the crystalline nature of nanoparticles (Figure 3). XRD patterns showed four major peaks in the entire spectrum of 2θ value extending from 20–80 degrees. The mean size of the crystallites was 13–26 nm and the size of the silver nanocrystallites was 21 nm as assessed from the full width at half maximum of the peaks via the Debye– Scherrer formulae. TEM micrographs showed nanoparticles with various shapes; however, most were spherical. The size of the particles ranged from 5–30 nm (Figure 4)
