Synthesis of selenium nanoparticles (C@SeNPs) using C. caspius aqueous extract
The 10 g dried C. caspius was cut into smaller pieces and heated at 45–50 °C for 1 hr with 80 ml deionized water. Then, the flask was sonicated for 30 min. The obtained extract was filtered by filter paper (Whatman No. 1) and the filtrate was used to prepare selenium nanoparticles.
For the biosynthesis of SeNPs using C. caspius extract, Na2SeO3 (17.3 mg) dissolved in 10 ml deionized water was shaken at 45–50 °C and 500 rpm, and then, C. caspius extract (5 ml) was added into the mixture. The reaction color changed from colorless to red or reddish-orange after 2 days, indicating that the Se ions had been reduced.

The size, shape, and distribution of C@SeNPs were investigated using the TEM image, as shown in
Fig. 2
a. C@SeNPs have a semi-spherical shape, and their average size is about 20.34 nm in the provided image. The image proved the fabrication of NPs that were capped with their biomoites. In addition, the SEM image (
Fig. 2
b) revealed a semi-spherical shape for the surface morphology of C@SeNPs with an average particle size of around 23.47 nm, which is very close to the TEM results. Furthermore, synthesized NPs possess a good polydispersity. The histogram from the SEM image demonstrated that about 90 % of the fabricated C@SeNPs possess a size range of 10–40 nm (
Fig. 2
c). Keskin et al. synthesized SeNPs using Lysinibacillus sp. NOSK and the SEM analysis showed a spherical shape around 130 nm (
Keskin et al., 2020
). In a study in 2019, according to the SEM data, the prepared SeNPs were spherical shape with a size range of approximately 100–150 nm (
Menon et al., 2019
).
The XRD analysis is conducted to investigate the phase composition and crystalline nature of the plant-mediated SeNPs, which is presented in
Fig. 2
g. The result shows several Bragg’s reflections at (1 0 0), (1 0 1), (1 1 0), (1 0 2), (1 1 1), (2 0 1), (1 1 2), (2 0 2), (2 1 0), (2 1 1), and (1 1 3) ascribing 23.61, 29.85, 41.36, 43.83, 45.52, 51.83, 56.20, 61.67, 65.11, 67.95, and 71.75 of trigonal selenium crystallographic planes (
Menon et al., 2021
). The green synthesis of SeNPs using Withania somnifera, Emblica oficinalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (
Amiri et al., 2021
) was consistent with our study. The crystallite size is evaluated using the well-known Debye-Scherrer equation (
Menon et al., 2020
). The calculated crystallite size for our synthesized SeNPs is about 33.42 nm.
