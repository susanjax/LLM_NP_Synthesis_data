Synthesis of copper oxide nanoparticles.
Copper oxide nanoparticles was synthesized by a modified chemical precipitation method. In brief, 90 mg Cu(NO3)2.3H2O at the concentration of 0.02 M was heated to 80 °C under reflux with addition of 400 μl 1 M NaOH solution. The color of the solution turned to dark blue, 157 mg platelet NaOH was rapidly added to the solution to reach the final pH of 5–6. The black precipitate of CuO nanoparticle were centrifuged, washed and dried in the vacuum oven.
Characterization of CuO NPs.
The morphologies and size were characterized by the transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai 20 Model) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, HITACHI S-4160 Model). The average particle size was calculated by dynamic light scattering (DLS, Malvern). The UV–visible spectra were obtained in the region of 200–600 nm (spectrophotometer, Biochrom, England).
Electron microscopy images and the distribution histogram of copper oxide nanoparticles and chitosan microparticle are shown in Fig. 1. The copper oxide nanoparticles showed an average size of 8 nm with narrow size distribution mainly spherical.
