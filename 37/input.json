mycogenic synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles
All the 65 fungi were screened for the biogenic synthesis of both silver and gold nanoparticles. Typically, 10 g (wet weight) of fungal mat was brought in contact with 100 mL sterile double distilled water in an Erlen Meyer flask and was kept under shaker condition (120 rpm) for 48 h at 27 °C. Then, the mycelial free filtrate was obtained by passing it through Whatman filter paper No. 1. The filtrate was reacted with known quantity of silver nitrate to yield an overall Ag+ ion concentration of 10−3 M and the reaction was carried out in dark at room temperature. Concurrently, the mycelial free extract and silver nitrate solution were maintained as controls and the change in color was observed up to 48 h. For gold nanoparticle synthesis, gold chloride was added in the place of silver nitrate and the same conditions were provided (Fayaz et al., 2010).

The very first indication for nanoparticle synthesis is color change. Brown and pinkish violet color formed in the optimized medium indicated the mycosynthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles, respectively. On the other hand, fungal biomass and substrate solution retained the original color. The color change was due to the excitation of surface plasmon vibrations, which is a characteristic feature of synthesized nanoparticles (Song et al., 2009). The absorption peaks recorded at 430 and 535 nm in the UV–vis. spectra further confirmed the formation of silver and gold nanoparticles, respectively. HR-TEM image confirmed spherical shaped, well-dispersed silver nanoparticles (Fig. 3a) and the inset of Fig. 3a showed the SAED pattern. However, silver nanoparticles synthesized by Bacillus spp. were found to be triangular, hexagonal, and spherical (Elbeshehy et al., 2015). The particle size distribution analysis revealed an average size of 8–20 nm diameters by calculating 120 randomly selected silver nanoparticles in HR-TEM images (Fig. 3b). On the other hand, gold nanoparticles were of 10–20 nm in size with spherical shape; intriguingly, some particles were found to have anisotropic morphology with a size of 10–50 nm (Fig. 4a). SAED pattern of gold nanoparticles was also shown in the inset of Fig. 4a. The particle size distribution analysis of mycosynthesized gold nanoparticles showed an average diameter size of 15–30 nm (Fig. 4b).
The XRD analysis showed three distinct Bragg reflections corresponding to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) orientations of the face-centered cubic (fcc) silver (Fig. 3c). The data obtained was matched well with the database of Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) file No. 04-0783, indicating the crystalline nature of silver nanoparticles. Similar to this, the XRD spectrum of gold nanoparticles also showed three clear diffraction peaks at planes corresponding to fcc gold (Fig. 4c) and was matched well with the JCPDS file No. 04-0784.
