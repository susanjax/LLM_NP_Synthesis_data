Green synthesis of MgO nanoparticles by garlic extract
Garlic cloves acquired locally were peeled, washed in deionized water, chopped, and air dried. A grinder pulverizes whole cloves into a powder. The maceration procedure was used for the extraction. Garlic powder (15 g) was steeped in 300 ml of deionized water for 24 h with continuous stirring. Finally, filter paper with a pore size of 0.2 m was used to remove any remaining solids from the extract before it was kept at 4 °C for later use.
A solution was produced by adding 1 g of magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2·6H2O) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) with 20 ml of garlic extract, followed by stirring for 30 min at room temperature. Following this, a 5 ml of sodium hydroxide solution (0.2 M) was slowly added to the amalgam until a visible precipitate was formed. The precipitate was then subjected to multiple washes with deionized water and subsequently dried at a temperature of 60 °C for overnight. Following this, the sample was subjected to a calcination procedure at a temperature of 500 °C for a period of 2 h to get fine powder of MgO nanoparticles.

 shows the FESEM characterization of environmental-friendly produced MgO nanoparticles. The typical SEM micrographs of MgO nanoparticles are shown in
Fig. 2
A and B at varying magnifications. These SEM images reveal that the MgO nanoparticles are about 60 nm in size. The elemental composition was determined using SEM-EDX analysis, and the results showed a stoichiometric amount of Mg (52.36 wt%) and O (47.64 wt%) (
