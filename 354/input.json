Fabrication of chitosan-encapsulated-NiO-TiO2-Farnesol hybrid nanomaterials (CNTF HNMs)
To produce the CNTF HNMs, 500 mg of TiO2 NPs and 0.1 M Ni (NO3)2. 6H2O were blended, and 1 % acetic acid was added to 50 mL and used to dissolve 500 mg of chitosan. The Chitosan-NiO-TiO2 solution also contained 50 mg farnesol (phytochemical). Then, NaOH solution (0.1 M) was gradually added to the Chitosan-NiO-TiO2-Farnesol solution. The dark residue was collected. The residue was heated for 3 h at ambient temperature using a magnetic stirrer. The produced nanopowder was cleaned with ethanol and deionized water at various intervals. At −3 °C and 15,000 rpm for 40 min, the resultant solution was centrifuged. The dark residue was calcined at 600 °C for 5 h, after being dried at 120 °C for 2 h.
FESEM analysis and EDAX spectra of chitosan-encapsulated-NiO-TiO2-Farnesol hybrid nanomaterials
FESEM micrographs of the CNTF HNMs at lower and higher magnifications are shown in Fig. 2a and b. In the CNTF HNMs, the NiO NPs spread unevenly across the TiO2 NPs, interacting with the chitosan and farnesol molecules, as illustrated in Fig. 2a and b. The hexagonal structure of the CNTF HNMs and the presence of agglomerates with an average particle size of 35 nm are observed in the FESEM images. Fig. 2(c) presents the EDAX spectra of the CNTF HNMs. The occurrence of C-, N-, Ti-, Ni-, and O-related peaks during the EDAX examination confirmed the development of CNTF HNMs. The atomic percentages in the CNTF HNMs were determined by the EDAX analysis to be 8.56 % (C), 7.25 % (N), 23.20 % (Ni), 14.35 % (Ti), and 46.64 % (O).
X-ray diffraction patterns of chitosan-encapsulated-NiO-TiO2-Farnesol hybrid nanomaterials
Fig. 4a displays the XRD patterns of the fabricated CNTF HNMs. For NiO, the diffraction peaks were located at 37.12°, 43.32°, 62.93°, 75.53°, and 79.48°, corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes, respectively, indicating a cubic structure (JCPDS card No. 00-047-1049). The TiO2 NPs had an anatase TiO2 phase (JCPDS card No:21–1272), with diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.30°, 48.14°, and 61.76°, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Multiple orientations of the NiO and TiO2 NPs phases were detected in the CNTF HNMs. Characteristic peaks of chitosan were observed at 11.97°and 20.49°. In addition, farnesol diffraction peaks were observed at 14.07°and 16.91°.
