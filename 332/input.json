Preparation of Musa acuminata Pseudostem extract [MAPE]
Fresh Musa acuminata Pseudostems [MAP] were purchased from Coimbatore, India's local market, cleaned meticulously with Millipore water and sliced into small pieces. The substrate was allowed to shade dry for one week and powdered using a mixer grinder. Twenty grams of MAP powder were extracted with 100 mL Millipore water in a soxhlet extractor at 80ºC for 4 h. The supernatant was filtered through a Whatman 40 filter paper and the MAP extract was separated and stored at 4ºC for further use [19].
2.2. MAPE-mediated synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles
The iron oxide nanoparticles (i.e., MION) were prepared by co-precipitation wherein 50 mL of MAP extract was added dropwise to an equal volume of 0.5 M FeCl3 solution and allowed with continuous stirring for 120 min. The standard solution (0.1 N HCl and NaOH) was prepared separately to adjust the precipitate’s pH. The yellowish precipitate turned black due to the formation of iron oxide nanoparticles. Once the reaction was completed, the black-colored precipitate was separated by filtration, rinsed with Millipore water, washed with absolute ethanol several times, and desiccated under vacuum at 40ºC for 6 hr to collect the final product (i.e., MION).

        The XRD pattern obeys the Bragg angle diffraction phenomenon with different intensities at 2θ = 35.6º, 43.39º,57.43º,62.85º and 94.74º. This implies that the intense peak at 35.6º was due to the (110) lattice plane of iron oxide nanoparticles shown in Fig. 2(c). The literature shows that iron nanoparticles comprise pure iron inside the core and a layer of oxide over the shell, which results from oxidation from the outside atmosphere. The Bragg angle at 43.39º supported the cubic phase structure as suggested by Li et al. (2017) [31]. Meanwhile, many smaller peaks are also observed, possibly due to the influence of phenolic compounds and bio-reductants. The average crystalline size of the nanoparticles was found to be around 20 nm.
The particle size of the MION was further confirmed with the results of HR-TEM analysis. Prasad (2016) inferred that the iron nanoparticles synthesized using leaf extract of Mansoaalliacea and ferrous sulfate as precursors resulted in 18 nm nanoparticle formation [1]. Carbon coated, LDH was prepared and studied for the removal of MG and CV exhibited the hexagonal plate like structure [62]. On the other hand, Eshaghi et al. (2017) also produced narrow-sized magnetic nanoparticles with super magnetic properties [25].

The SEM analysis was performed to study the size and shape of the MION, as depicted in Fig. 3(a). SEM image clarifies the spherical morphology of the MION. The elemental composition studied using the EDX spectrum (Fig. 3(b)) indicated the presence of oxygen, chloride ions, and the elemental magnetic material. In addition, SEM topology was carried out to understand the spherical shape of the prepared nanoparticles. Aggregates of iron oxide nanoparticles were also exhibited along with smaller spherical-shaped particles.
Furthermore, the reducing agents in the Musa acuminata pseudostem extract were engaged in nanoparticle dispersion, and agglomeration was also due to the specific chemical reactivity. This can be avoided by proper surface attachment chemicals for good colloidal stability [2], [32]. Fig. 3(c) and (d) showed an HR-TEM image of the MION, clearly illustrating the different narrow sizes of nanoparticles, i.e., below 60 nm. Harshiny et al. (2015) also reported that the Fe nanoparticles obtained in their study were cubic and roughly spherical with lesser aggregation [26], [33]. The HR-TEM image greatly supported the results compared with SEM morphology. From The HR-TEM image of MION, agglomeration was also observed. The results are in accordance with reduced graphene oxide prepared through green route indicated the electrostatic attraction during the adsorption process [63].
