Different concentrations of the plant extract were allowed to react with the 1 mM silver nitrate solution in the ratios: 1:10, 1:9, 1:8, 1: 5, 1:4, and 1:1. After being stirred for 20 min using a magnetic stirrer, the solution was stored in the dark. The color change from pale yellow to reddish-brown provided preliminary evidence that silver nanoparticles had formed. In the UV–visible range of 300–600 nm, the UV spectra were recorded at three time intervals, namely 0 h, 24 h, and 72 h to check the stability of silver nanoparticles [16]. The optimal ratio of plant extract to 1 mM silver nitrate solution and the best time for nanoparticle production was calculated to be a 1:10 ratio for the leaf extract whereas a 1:4 ratio for the root extract with a reaction duration of 24 h. Then, the reaction mixture (plant extracts + silver nitrate solution) was centrifuged (Sorvall ST 8R) at 8000 rpm for 30 min. Thus, collected silver nanoparticles were stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C to prevent the sample from agglomeration. The plant samples collected, the sample prepared, and the color changed after the addition of AgNO3 are shown in Fig. 1.
The X-ray diffraction study was carried out to establish the crystalline nature of the particles. The XRD pattern of synthesized AgNPs assisted by root extracts has shown four intense peaks corresponding to (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of the face-centered cubic lattice structure of metallic silver (JCPDS-ICDD files no. 00-004-0783, which verifies the crystalline character of silver nanoparticles and validates their effective synthesis [29]. Bragg's reflection (2θ = 38.30°, 44.41°, 64.59°, and 77.50°). Similarly, AgNPs synthesized by assisting the root extract have shown four intense peaks corresponding to (111), (200), (220), and (311). Bragg's reflection (2θ = 38.30°, 44.41°, 64.59°, and 77.50°) is due to the structure of AgNPs. The average crystallite size of the root extract-assisted synthesized AgNPs was calculated using the Debye-Scherer formula to determine the width of each diffraction peak after the Gaussian fitting of all four peaks and found as 11.01 nm and 13.39 nm respectively. The size of nanoparticles reported in the literature was less than the size found in this study [30], the crystallite size of silver nanoparticles was found to be 5 nm. The XRD patterns of AgNPs are shown in Fig. 4.
The FE-SEM was used to analyze the morphological structure as well as to calculate the particle size of nanoparticles. High-density AgNPs were produced by Rhus chinensis root and leaf extract, according to FE-SEM examination. It was demonstrated that root extract and leaf extract assisted synthesis of AgNPs were mostly spherical with diameters of 54.40 nm and 30.89 nm, respectively [31]. also examined that synthesized silver nanoparticles formed by using the Rivina humilis leaf extract were found to be spherical with a diameter of 51 nm showing some similarity to the present study. The bioorganic capping molecules that were coupled to the silver nanoparticles interacted with one another via hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions to produce the silver nanoparticles' SEM image. The FE-SEM images show the particle size at different resolutions which are shown in Fig. 5 (a), (b), and (c) and 8 (a), (b) and (c). EDX spectroscopy was used to evaluate the elemental composition on the surface of the biosynthesized nanomaterials. The EDX study and the color map proved the presence of the silver component. Figs. 6 and 9 showed the elemental mapping of synthesized AgNPs revealed the presence of silver, carbon, chlorine, oxygen, and nitrogen. Through, EDX the peak of silver in both AgNPs assisted by root and leaf extracts showed around 3 Kev due to SPR [32] and other elements like Cl, O, C, and N were also reported in synthesized AgNPs which were matched to the results reported in the literature [25]. Since, plant secondary metabolites serve as both capping and reducing agents in the extracts-assisted synthesis of AgNPs [33]. The FE-SEM of root extract-assisted synthesized AgNPs is shown in Fig. 5. The energy-dispersive X-ray EDX spectrum and elemental mapping of root extract-assisted AgNPs are shown in Fig. 6. The EDX spectrum of root-assisted synthesized AgNPs is shown in Fig. 7. The FE-SEM image of synthesized nanoparticles assisted by leaf extract and energy-dispersive X-ray is shown in Figs. 8 and 10. The particle size distribution is displayed in histograms which is shown in Fig. 11.
