2.1.1. Liquid crystalline nanoparticles
Liquid crystalline nanoparticles (LCNPs) were fabricated using the hydrotrope dilution method as previously described by Thorn et al. [15] . Briefly, 100 mg of glyceryl monooleate (Myverol 18–99 K, Kerry Ingredients and Flavors, Egham, UK), 15 mg of Pluronic F-127 and 270 mg of propylene glycol were dissolved in 10 mL of chloroform. A stream of nitrogen gas was introduced to evaporate the chloroform, leaving behind a thin lipid film. The film was hydrated with 100 µL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and diluted to 5 mL with Milli-Q, followed by vortex-mix to form a white suspension.
Cationic-LCNPs were synthesized by addition of 1% w/w of dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB) (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL, US) to the chloroform mix. Fluorescently-labelled particles were produced by the inclusion of either 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(Cyanine 7) (Cy7-PE) or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (ammonium salt) (Liss-Rhod PE) (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.) to the lipid matrix.
Vancomycin and tobramycin loaded LCNPs and cationic-LCNPs were also prepared using the same method as described above, but with the addition of 100 µL PBS doped with antibiotic (50 mg/mL).

  3.1. Synthesis and characterization of liquid crystalline lipid nanoparticles LCNPs in the size range of 190–210 nm were successfully synthesized from glyceryl monooleate, stabilized with Pluronic F-127 and incorporated with either vancomycin or tobramycin ( Table 1 ).
