Preparation of Nio-Gin
In this study, we used the thin film hydration method to synthesize niosomes [
13
]. 10 mg of Gin and accurately weighed quantities of the Span 60, and cholesterol was dissolved in 9 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v) at different molar ratios (
Table 1
). Organic solvent Evaporation was performed with a rotary evaporator (Heidolph Instruments, Schwabach, Germany) at 60 °C and 120 rpm for 30 min to form a thin lipid film. The PBS (pH 7.4) was added to the prepared films to hydrate them at 60 °C and 120 rpm for 30 min. Small unilamellar niosomes were obtained by 7 min sonication (UP50H compact laboratory homogenizer, Hielscher Ultrasonic, Teltow, Germany) (

Preparation of Nio-Gin@AL
AL solution (4 %) was prepared by dissolving the AL grind in a DMEM medium and then incubated at 60 °C with strong shaking for 4 h. Then, CaCl2 was added as a cross-linker suspension (40 mg/mL) to the AL suspension [
40
]. The optimum Gin-Nio was then centrifuged for 60 min (40,000 rpm), and the pellet was stirred to form a sodium AL suspension. Eventually, a CaCl2 suspension was added into the Gin-Nio, combined with AL suspension (Gin-Nio@AL), and allowed to be engaged thermally and ionically at 4 °C for 60 min (

As mentioned, the size, zeta potential, and dispersion were evaluated by a Nano Zetasizer.

A shows the particle size curve of empty niosome (Nio), Nio-Gin, and Nio-Gin@AL. As can be seen, the particle size and dispersion of the prepared formulations are appropriate (

 represents the zeta potential of fabricated nanoparticles. The zeta potential of Nio (

-A), Nio-Gin (

-C) were − 26.1 ± 1.1, −15.4 ± 1.5, and − 21 ± 1.7, respectively.

Among formulations prepared with lipid content of 300 μmol, those formulated based on 1:1 M ratios of surfactant per cholesterol had more petite size and PDI in contrast with a formulation designed based on 2:1 M surfactant ratios per cholesterol. Accordingly, formulations from 300 μmol of Lipid content and surfactant to cholesterol molar ratio of 1:1 were selected for further analyses. Eventually, the optimized sample was coated with AL (Nio-Gin@AL), giving rise to the Gin-loaded niosomal formulation. The size, PDI, and EE were measured as 241 ± 9 nm, 0.26 ± 0.02, and 94.9 ± 1.4 %, respectively.
