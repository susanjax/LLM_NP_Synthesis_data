Extracellular synthesis of silver nanoparticles
The microorganisms were cultivated on 75 mL of lysogeny broth medium (LB) and maintained at 37 °C on an 211DS incubator with an orbital agitator (Labnet International Inc., Edison, NJ, USA) at 120 rpm for 24 h. After the incubation period, the cultures were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were used for the next experiments. To carry out the synthesis, 7.5 ml of the supernatant was added drop by drop with constant agitation (550 rpm) on 30 mL of 1 mM aqueous AgNO3 solution. Subsequently, the mixture was maintained on constant agitation at 550 rpm for 27 h under darkness conditions. The temperature (30 °C and 60 °C) and pH (7, 8, 9, and 10) effects were studied on the AgNPs’ formation. The pH was adjusted with NaOH and HCl. All the treatments were conducted in triplicate, using as control the microorganisms’ supernatant without AgNO3 under the same conditions described above. The AgNPs green synthesis was visualized by colorimetric changes in the solution, turning from yellow pale to brownish tones. Synthesis was also confirmed using the UV–vis spectrophotometer at 1 h intervals for 27 h.
 Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using intracellular extracts
The bacterial growth described in Section 2.2 was centrifuged at 5000 rpm, and then 2 g of biomass was resuspended on 10 mL Milli-Q® water and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm. This process was conducted three times to wash the biomass. Subsequently, the obtained suspension was subjected to cellular lysis by sonication for 12 min, with a 15 s pulse on and a 45 s pulse off, at 45 % amplitude, using the Qsonica Q700 sonicator (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, EE. UU.). The lysed cultures were centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm. For the synthesis, 10 mL of the lysed culture were mixed with 10 mL of a 1 mM aqueous AgNO3 solution. The mixture was maintained on constant agitation at 550 rpm at 60 °C for 24 h under darkness conditions. The treatment was conducted in triplicate. The AgNPs green synthesis was visualized by colorimetric changes in the solution. Synthesis was also confirmed using the UV–vis spectrophotometer after 24 h.
As shown in Table 1, the AgNPs synthesized using the intracellular extracts of B. subtilis and B. megaterium were found to be more stable, with zeta potential values of −34.1 mV and −33.9 mV, respectively, compared with C. necator, which yielded a zeta potential value of −21.4 mV. Fig. 5 shows the histograms of AgNPs synthesized. According to Dhiman et al. (2021), zeta potential values above −30 mV indicate high NPs stability [53]. On the other hand, in the AgNPs synthesized using the supernatant, all the zeta potential values were between −18.1 and −21.9 mV, which indicates a lower stability compared with the AgNPs synthesized using the intracellular extracts. These differences could be due to the different biomolecules present in the intracellular and supernatant extracts, such as carbohydrates, proteins and lipids [54]. In the case of the intracellular extract, the presence of DNA, c-type cytochromes, peptides, cellular enzymes such as nitrate reductase, and reducing cofactors could favor the synthesis and stabilization of AgNPs [55], preventing their aggregation and providing greater stability compared to the AgNPs synthesized with the supernatant. Considering this information, it is possible to associate the different values of the zeta potential to the greater availability of stabilizing factors that can be found in the intracellular extract, which can be corroborated by means of the protein and DNA quantification results in Section 3.2. According to these results, it is important to take into account the stability over time of nanoparticles for the desired application, for example, nanoparticle formulations that need to be applied constantly, such as disinfectant sprays, may not require high stability over time compared to nanomedicines. Nanoparticles can also be modulated to generate better stability, using precision electrostatic/charge or precision polymer methods, as mentioned in the work by Sperling and Parak [56]. In addition, other factors such as antimicrobial activity should be taken into account in order to determine the potential use of AgNPs.

TEM images (Fig. 6, Fig. 7) revealed different shapes and sizes between the AgNPs synthesized with the different microorganisms and the type of extract (supernatant or intracellular extract), spherical being the most predominant shape. Similarly, Ameen et al. (2020), obtained AgNPs using Cupriavidus sp. with spherical morphology and sizes between 10 and 50 nm, while Stancu, 2021 performed a similar experiment using B. megaterium and obtained spherical AgNPs with a size between 1 and 85 nm [48,75]. It has been demonstrated that different microorganisms secrete different biomolecules in different proportions [76], such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides [54,57], which have been reported as molecules responsible for the green synthesis of AgNPs. In addition, associated with the EDS analyzes present in Fig. 6 (g, h and i) and Fig. 7 (g, h and i), silver was observed by a Ag peak in the EDS spectrum of all samples. Furthermore, the presence of elements such as copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), carbon (C) and oxygen (O) was also detected, however, it is important to emphasize that the other elements observed in the analyzes come from the chemical structure of the carbon tape and the copper grid used in the assembly of the samples.
