Biosynthesis of AgNPs
The biosynthesis of AgNPs using bakul leaves extract is illustrated in Fig. 2. The AgNPs were synthesized by adding the extract solution to a 1 mM silver nitrate solution in different ratios, followed by stirring on a magnetic stirrer at 323 K. The formation of AgNPs was monitored by observing the color change of the reaction mixture at various time intervals. Additionally, UV–Visible spectroscopic measurements of the absorption spectra in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm were performed at regular intervals to analyze the production of AgNPs. After the synthesis process, centrifugation was employed to recover the produced AgNPs for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The obtained AgNPs were washed several times with deionized water and dried.The green synthesized AgNPs were characterized for their physicochemical and biological properties using various analytical techniques. Several key parameters for nanoparticle synthesis, including reaction time, precursor to bioextract ratio, pH, and temperature of the reaction mixture, were examined. To investigate the effects of these parameters on AgNPs synthesis, experiments were conducted with varying values of the parameters of concern
X-ray crystallography proved that nanoparticles were crystals. Fig. 7(a) displays the synthesised AgNPs' XRD pattern. The diffracted intensities were measured from 10 to 90°. The four strong Bragg reflections at 38.12, 46.21, 64.50, and 77.22 correspond to the planes of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (3 1 1), respectively, according to the facets of the FCC crystal structure of silver. In agreement with standard silver values, the interplanar spacing (d calculated) values for the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (3 1 1) planes were 2.360, 1.963, 1.443, and 1.236, respectively. The peak around 32.150 was related to silver oxide (Ag2O). The unit cell parameter a is found to be 4.0689 Å. SynthesizedAgNPscrystallite sizes were estimated by the Scherrer's method as Eq. (1)
Using transmission electron microscopy, the synthesized AgNPs' morphology and size properties were further defined. The size of the AgNPs, which ranged from 10 to 30 nm, was also observed by the TEM Fig. 7(b), confirming their spherical shape. Due to its better resolution, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) is frequently applied when SEM characterization of a particular sample fails to produce a clear or good morphology. AgNPs are visibly circular and aggregated in the FESEM picture depicted in the Fig. 7(c),which the HRTEM image supports further. The range of particle sizes is 10 nm to 30 nm.
