Synthesis of Ag2(BDC) MOF
For all the synthesis routes of Ag2(BDC), 77 mg of AgNO3 was dissolved in 2 mL of NH3 water solution (25 wt%) in an amber flask, then 4 mL of DMSO was added to the solution and stirred. Then 170 mg of H2BDC was dissolved in 16 mL of DMSO. The two solutions were heated at 50 °C and the ligand's solution was slowly added to the metal solution under stirring at 50 °C. White crystals were formed when almost half ligand's solution was added as an intermediate reaction product. Then, three routes of synthesis were used: route a, route b, and route c. All crystals obtained during the synthesis were collected, filtered, and washed two times with DMSO, once with water and once with ethanol. To obtain dry powders, the crystals were kept in a vacuum vessel at 25 °C for a few hours. The obtained products were stored at room temperature in the dark until their characterization.

XRD patterns (Fig. 3a) of a-AgMOF powders indicate the formation of crystalline Ag2BDC with the monoclinic structure (P21/c space group) according to the reported crystallographic data.31 SEM analysis (Fig. 3d) shows the formation of well-shaped rhombohedral crystals with dimensions greater than 20 μm. The a-AgMOF FT-IR spectra (Fig. 3b) show two strong peaks at 1567 cm−1 and 1376 cm−1 which are shifted compared to the main peaks of the H2BDC carboxylic group (C[double bond, length as m-dash]O stretching at 1687 cm−1 and the C–OH stretching at 1288 cm−1), thus suggesting the formation of carboxylate salt peaks.50
