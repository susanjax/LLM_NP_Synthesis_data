Palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) was contributed from a palm oil refinery plant, Thailand. EFB was washed, dried, and milled to approximately 75–300 μm (+50/−200 mesh). Sodium thiosulfate and anhydrous ethyl alcohol (99.9%) were purchased from Daejung, Korea. P-phenylenediamine and diethanolamine were supplied from Alfa Aesar, Germany. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was obtained from Acros organics, Germany and acetone was purchased from Fisher chemical, USA. Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was acquired from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Ultrapure water was purified by a New Human UP System, Korea (18.3 MΩ cm at 25 °C). For MTT assay, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; high glucose, pyruvate, powder), minimal essential medium α (MEM; nucleosides, powder), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and antibiotic-antimycotic (anti-anti) were purchased from Gibco (Billings, MT, United States). Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), sodium bicarbonate, and thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. (Darmstadt, Germany). PBS 10× was obtained from Omics Bio (New Taipei City, Taiwan). All chemicals were used as received. L-929 and NIH/3 T3 cell lines were obtained from the National Health Research Institutes (Miaoli, Taiwan).
The synthesis of carbon dots (CDs) and N,S doped carbon dots (NS/CDs)
A single step hydrothermal method was used to synthesize CDs from EFB. 2.5 g EFB was mixed with ultrapure water at 1:20 of solid: liquid ratio (w/w) in a Teflon-lined high-pressure reactor. The reaction took place at 220 °C for 6 h and then cooled down to room temperature naturally. The solid fraction was separated using centrifugation at 11,000 rpm for 20 min and brown solution containing CDs was purified using microfiltration with a 0.22 μm filter membrane and further dialyzed by using membrane (MWCO 1.0 kDa) for 48 h. For nitrogen and sulfur doped CDs (NS/CDs), p-phenylenediamine and sodium thiosulfate were used respectively. The N- and S-doping agents at different concentration from 0.20 mol L−1 to 0.40 mol L−1 were mixed with EFB at the same solid: liquid ratio. The CDs and NS/CDs synthesis procedure of our group and the characterization were reported elsewhere (Saengsrichan et al., 2022a; Saengsrichan et al., 2022b; Sangjan et al., 2022). The CDs and NS/CDs samples were stored at 4 °C for further use and characterization.

Synthesis of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) and in-situ CDs@MSN nanocomposite
To synthesize MSN, SiO2 nanoparticles were firstly formed by mixing of 7 mL ethanol, 50 μL diethanolamine and 10 mL ultrapure water with 0.2 g CTAB, and subsequently the solution was stirred at 60 °C for 30 min. After 0.5 h, 2 mL TEOS was rapidly added and the mixture was maintained stirring for further 2 h. After the reaction, silicon dioxide nanoparticles (SiO2) were obtained from centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 5 min and the precipitate was dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. For in-situ CDs@MSN nanocomposite, CDs solution from the previous step was added instead of ultrapure water during CDs@SiO2 synthesis. In order to obtain porous reduced MSN or CDs@MSN nanocomposite, the prepared SiO2 or CDs@SiO2 nanoparticles were taken into a three-neck round bottom flask, then 100 mL acetone was added and the reduction took place at 80 °C under reflux for 18 h. After centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 5 min, the final products (MSN or CDs@MSN) were dried at 60 °C for 24 h. In case of NS/CDs@MSN, the prepared NS/CDs solution was added instead of CDs solution. All the MSN, CDs@MSN and NS/CDs@MSN samples were stored in an auto-desiccator (25% relative humidity) for further use and characterization. The method for in-situ synthesis of MSN, CDs@MSN or NS/ CDs@MSN nanocomposite was shown in Scheme

FESEM images demonstrated the morphology of CDs@MSN and NS/CDs@MSN synthesized as illustrated in Fig. 3. From the SEM images, the shape of MSN without and with adding carbon dots (CDs or NS/CDs) was spherical for all samples with excellent particle size uniformity. The average diameter of MSN from FESEM images was ∼19.8 nm (Fig. 3(D)). Formation of nanocomposites with either CDs or NS/CDs made MSN nanoparticles’ characteristics changed i.e., surface morphology and particle size. The CDs@MSN (∼23.1 nm) likewise appeared spherical (Fig. 3(A)) but the particle size was larger than MSN. The average size of 0.20 M NS/CDs@MSN at ∼20.5 nm (Fig. 3(B)) was not markedly changed compared to CDs@MSN, however the average size of 0.40 M NS/CDs@MSN (∼46.4 nm) was largest among all samples as shown in Fig. 3(C). Similar trend was observed by FETEM images and size analysis (Fig. 5). More accurate size distribution was calculated using FETEM images as demonstrated in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 for the samples before and after reflux, respectively.
