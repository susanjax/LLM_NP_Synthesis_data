Synthesis of Au nanoparticles
Chemical reagents. Gold (III) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4x H2O) was used as a gold precursor. Sodium borohydrate (98%, NaBH4), silver nitrate (≥99%, AgNO3), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (99%, CTAB), L-ascorbic acid (≥98%, AA), tannic acid (C76H52O46), potassium iodide (99%, KI) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Deionized water was used in all experiments. All glassware was washed with aqua regia (3:1 hydrochloric acid to nitric acid by volume) and rinsed copiously with water.

2.1.1 Au nanospheres
Spheres were prepared by adding a water solution of 10 mL of 6 × 10−3 M tannic acid to the boiling solution of 1.3 × 10−3 M HAuCl4 and the boiling was continued for 2 min [9]. The reduction was found to be as fast as indicated by a red color appearing and the reaction was completed within 1 min. Tannic acid was used as a reducing and stabilizing agent.

2.1.2 Au nanoflowers
5 mL of aqueous 200 mM CTAB solution was prepared and added to 4 mM AgNO3. In the next step, 5 mL of 1 mM HAuCl4 and 50 μL of 100 mM L-ascorbic acid were added and mixed by shaking. Growth was initiated by injecting 10 μL of freshly prepared 2.25 mM NaBH4. Mixing continued for 20 s, after which the solution was left undisturbed for 24 h. The reaction products were sedimented by centrifugation (7000 rpm, 3 × 20 min, 30 °C), the supernatant was discarded and the particles were dispersed in water.

2.1.3 Au nanorods
Seed-mediated nanorods were prepared according to the literature protocols [10]. (i) Seed Solution. 0.6 mL of ice-cold 0.01 M NaBH4 was added to the stirred solution (5 mL, 0.2 M) CTAB. The solution was stirred vigorously for 3 min, after which the solution was kept at 27 °C for 6 h.

(ii) Growth of nanorods. In a typical synthesis, (5 mL, 0.2 M) CTAB was added to 0.15 mL 4 mM AgNO3 solution. Then, 5 mL of 1 mM HAuCl4 solution was added, followed by t70 µL of 0.0788 M L-ascorbic acid. The final step was the addition of 12 µL of the seed solution to the growth solution at 27–30 °C. The reaction products were isolated by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 4 × 20 min, 30 °C) followed by removal of the supernatant.

2.1.4 Au nanoprism
Nanoprisms were prepared as described by Straney et al. [11] with several changes. 10 μL of 50 mM of NaI was added to a mixture solution of 10 mL of 50 mM CTAB and 10 mM of HAuCl4. Next, 55 μL of 100 mM L-ascorbic acid was added, after which the solution turned from an orange color to a clear solution. The final step was the addition of 8 μL of 25 μM NaBH4. This was mixed for 30 s and the solution was left undisturbed for 24 h. Nanoprisms were separated from reaction impurities by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 3 × 20 min, 30 °C) and were suspended in water.

2.1.5 Au nanostars
A two-step procedure was used to synthesize Au nanostars: (i) Seed Solution was prepared by reducing gold ions by means of tannic acid as described in Au nanospheres [9]. (ii) Growth of nanostars. First, 4.75 mL of 0.1 M CTAB solution was prepared by heating the mixture until it became clear. Then, an aqueous 0.01 M solution of gold precursor was added to 0.1 M CTAB solution in a scintillation vial. The solution was mixed gently. In the next step, 30 µL of 0.01 M AgNO3 solution and 32 µL of a 0.1 M L-ascorbic acid solution were added in this order. The solution was stirred on a benchtop vortex mixer. Finally, 20 µL of Au NPs seed solution was added, after which the solution was left undisturbed for 1 day. The temperature of the growth medium was kept constant at 28–30 °C in all the experiments. The reaction products were isolated by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 3 × 10 min, 30 °C) followed by removal of the supernatant [12].

3.1 Morphology and UV–Vis properties of gold nanoparticles
The size and morphology of the synthesized AuNPs were evaluated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 1). The optical properties of the particles were characterized by UV–Vis spectroscopy (Fig. 2). The red colour of gold colloid is attributed to surface plasmon resonance arising from the collective oscillation of free conduction electrons induced by an interacting electromagnetic field [13]. It is known that the position and intensity of the band depends on the size, surface morphology and aspect ratio of nanostructures [14,15,16]. For the spherical gold particles dispersed in the colloidal solution the average diameter ranged from 4 to approximately 28 nm, as shown in Fig. 1a and Online Resource 1. The average AuNPs size (diameter) was calculated from the statistical average sizes of 100 nanoparticles. The major fraction of spherical AuNPs appears with an average size of approximately 10 nm (Fig. 1a). An absorption band around a wavelength of λ~ 530 nm was observed for spherical particles and this peak position suggests the presence of small particles of gold [17] (Fig. 2). UV−Vis absorption spectra of nanorods (length = 38 ± 7 nm, diameter = 16 ± 4 nm) produced using seed-mediated synthesis exhibited a characteristic longitudinal localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) at a wavelength of λ~ 663 nm and a transverse LSPR at a wavelength of λ~ 521 nm (Online Resource 1 and Fig. 2). The major fraction of rods appears with an average length size ~ 41 nm (Fig. 1b)
Flower-like morphology with NPs size range from 340 to 410 nm were obtained as shown in Fig. 1c. The major fraction of flower-like Au nanoparticles appears with an average size 370 nm. 
Nanoprisms (edge length = 138 ± 42 nm) exhibited a broad peak with a maximum LSPR at a wavelength of λ~ 545 nm and a very low peak at 1200 nm (Fig. 1d and Fig. 2).
The SEM analysis shows that the gold nanostars have a tip-to-tip distance in the range 160–260 nm (Fig. 1e and Online Resource 1). The major fraction of stars AuNPs appears with an average size of approximately 240 nm.
