Bio-Synthesis and Purification of TiO2 NPs
The TiO2 NPs synthesis was performed by incubating 100 mL of plant extracts with 900 mL of the freshly prepared aqueous solution of 25 mM Titanium dioxide (TiO2) at 60 °C. The TiO2 NPs were attained by incubating the reaction mixture at 60 °C for 2 h or until the formation of a white precipitate of TiO2 NPs.
The resulting TiO2 NPs were purified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min, then washed the pellets containing nanoparticles thrice with distilled deionized water and then air-dried.
Characterization of TiO2 Nanoparticles
DLS measurements were used to study the TiO2 nanoparticles size distribution. Figure 3 shows a typical dynamic light scattering histogram of green synthesized titanium dioxide nanoparticle with the average particle size (hydrodynamic diameter) equal to (74.8 ± 0.649) nm.
TEM image of the biosynthesized TiO2 NPs (Figure 4) revealed that the morphology of the biosynthesized titanium oxide nanoparticles possesses a uniform spherical structure in shape having a diameter in the range of 10–30 nm.
Figure 5 represented XRD pattern of biosynthesized titanium oxide nanoparticles using Juniperus phoenicea leaf extract. Nine distinct peaks at 2θ = 27.1°, 35.7°, 40.8°, 43.9°, 53.9°, 56.0°, 63.9°, 68.8°, and 69.8° that can be indexed as (110), (101), (111), (210), (211), (220), (310), (301), and(112) Miller indices. The JCPDS Card no. 21-1276. The existence of peak pattern confirmed the crystal structure of TiO2 NPs. XRD pattern showed the crystalline nature of the TiO2 nanoparticles and the calculated average size of TiO2 nanoparticles ~10 nm. The peaks sharpness and the absence of unknown peaks confirmed the crystalline nature and high purity of the biosynthesized TiO2 NPs.
