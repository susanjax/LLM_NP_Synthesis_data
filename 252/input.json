Synthesis of silver nanoparticles
The first step in this procedure involved preparing 5 ml concentration of leaf extract and an aqueous solution (0.01 mM) of silver nitrate (AgNO3). The next step was adding the leaf extract to 10 ml of 0.01 mM AgNO3 solution that was prepared. The color of the solution (leaf extract + Ag+) was changed from light yellow to dark brown after 20 min which was a sign of the creation of Ag NPs. The last step in this procedure was analyzing the resultant colloidal solution of silver via the use of spectrophotometer, TEM, and XRD.
Synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles
The procedure of synthesizing TiO2 nanoparticles was achieved in the following stages.
Firstly, the sol–gel process was used to prepare the nanoparticles of TiO2 through diluting titanium (IV) tetraisopropoxide [Ti (OCH(CH3)2)4] in an appropriate amount of glacial acetic acid. Secondly, an extra amount of deionized water was added in order to obtain a clear glutinous solution. The solution was stirred constantly for 5 h using a magnetic stirrer. The next stage was keeping the solution in the dark for 25 h so that the nucleation process is complete. After that, the solution was dried for 12 h at 120 °C in order to get the TiO2 crystals. Finally, the solution was grinded and calcined for 3 h at 500 °C to obtain the TiO2 nanoparticles.

Fig. 2
 displays the Ag and TiO2 nanoparticles' XRD spectrum. The value 2θ = 38.57°, 44.57°, 64.51°, and 77.47° represents the high peak as this value corresponds to the reflections from (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of Ag NPs (as shown in
Fig. 2
a). The typical pattern of green-synthesized Ag NPs appears to have a fcc structure when compared to JCPDS (file no: 89–3722). This phenomena for Ag NPs has also been observed and reported by other studies [
32
]. Moreover, there appeared two peeks at 32.25 and 46.21 but were weak when compared to those of silver. The bioorganic compounds that existed on the surface of the AgNPs were probably the cause for this. There also appeared the Unpredicted crystalline structures (32.25 and 46.21) which may be the result of the organic compounds in the leaf extract [
37
]. The studies of Jeeva et al. [
38
] reported similar observations as they found the crystalline peaks (32.28, 46.28, 54.83, 67.47 and 76.69). Those peaks were also identified by many works where the XRD pattern had the relevant 2 range. Obviously, these peaks and phytochemical appeared because of the compounds in the leaf extracts. Silver appears as the main constituent in the biosynthesis as shown by the stronger planes. As indicated by the TiO2 nanoparticles' diffraction pattern in (
Fig. 2
b), there are many characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 27.35°, 36.3°, 41.4°, 44.2°, 56.6°, and 61.6° corresponding to (110), (101), (200), (111), (210), (211), and (220) planes, respectively. This fact is in accordance with and match well previous reports [
39
]. That is, all these peaks are consistent with the tetragonal rutile TiO2 which shows compatibility with the information in card number (JCPDS card no.01-089-0552). Through the use of Debye–Scherrer's equation [
38
] the crystallite size of the Ag and TiO2 NPs for its maximum intensity peak was identified as shown in
Fig. 2
. The average size of the Ag particles was estimated 17 nm while the estimated size of TiO2 particles was 19 nm.
Fig. 3
 shows the XRD pattern of pure Cs/PEO blend to have a broad peak at 2θ = 20.23°. This can be attributed to the semicrystalline nature of Chitosan. It also exhibits two more peaks at 2θ = 19° and 23°. These peaks are small and are correlated with low-intensity peaks assigned to the PEO phases. The related blend XRD peaks exhibits alter and decrease in intensity while doped with Ag NPs. In the nanocomposites, the peaks corresponding to the Ag NPs have become prominent as shown in
Fig. 3
. This implies that the order of blend polymer crystallinity is disrupted by the coordination interactions between the functional groups of blend and Ag ions and as verified in the study of FT-IR. The pure blend XRD pattern displayed all the peaks originally existence in the blend with TiO2 crystalline diffraction. Compared to TiO2 NPs (2θ = 34.73), there is a shift in the two theta value of nanoparticles in the blended one (2θ = 35.87). This change means that the particles of TiO2 interact with the polymeric host mixture and this is an indicator of the fully dispersed nanoparticles in the blend. The presence of small particles of filler is the reason behind the decrease of semi-crystallinity of the Cs/PEO due to small filler particles disrupt the reorganization of the chain and make higher ionic conduction easier. The intensity peaks of the pure blend decrease with the addition of the nanofiller (Ag/TiO2) was observed, due to complete or fine dispersion of nanoparticles in the polymer blend and interaction of Ag/TiO2 nanoparticles with the blend. This interaction will improve the electrical conductivity, the thermal and dielectric properties, and the antibacterial activity of Cs/PEO-Ag/TiO2 nanocomposites as will be seen later in this study [
27
].

TEM analysis
TEM (
Fig. 4
) elucidates the size and shape of the resultant particles. Aliquots of the solution of Ag and TiO2 nanoparticles were put on a carbon-coated copper grid and dried under ambient conditions while recording the TEM images. The particles’ sizes were around 8–21 nm as indicated by the Ag NPs TEM micrographs (
Fig. 4
a), and they appeared to have spherical shape without any aggregation.
Fig. 4
 displays the distribution of the size of nanoparticles.
Fig. 4
b shows the TEM image of TiO2 NPs characterization which was made by the sol-gel technique. It is evident from the TEM micrographs that nanometric titanium oxide grains were formed with a distribution of uniform grain size and spherical-like particles having a diameter of around 10–23 nm (
Fig. 4
b), smaller than the XRD diffractograms calculated values. Also, a relatively uniform film was formed with an agglomeration trend of TiO2 nanoparticles without formation of aggregates [
40
]as shown by the TEM images in this system. The crystallite size of the Ag and TiO2 and the size of the one found in Scherrer relation in XRD measurements are in good agreement. To comparative between the results the TEM and XRD, The average particle size of nanomaterial samples from TEM results is greater than that obtained from XRD results, since the crystallite size is shown by the XRD, while the particle size that may consist of more than one crystallite is given by TEM.
