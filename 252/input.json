2.2. Preparation and characterization of colloidal chi-AgNPs
Colloidal chi-AgNPs were prepared following a previous study ( Adlim, 2006a ) with some modifications. It was prepared by dissolving 0.600 g of chitosan in 100 mL of 1.5% (v/v) aqueous acetic acid under magnetic stirring at room temperature. Then 20 mL of chitosan solution was diluted with the addition of 20 mL of methanol. AgNO3 crystal (0.1800 g) was weighed in a weighting-boat, and then it was transferred slowly into a 100 mL three-neck-round bottom flask under magnetic stirring. The weighting boat was rinsed with a few drops of distilled water. During AgNO3 dissolution, the flask was wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid direct contact with sunlight. The round flask was connected with a thermometer, rubber stopper, and a Liebig condenser and placed within a water bath. A Tungsten lamp (40 W) was placed 5 cm distance from the solution, and it was turned on to irradiate the solution for 90 min. The temperature solution might rise ∼40 °C in a water bath. Two milliliters of the solution were sampled to follow the color change from colorless to brown, indicating the formation of AgNPs. The absorbance of chi-AgNPs colloidal was recorded by using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer at 400–700 nm.

2.3. Coating and characterization of chitosan-coated white-silica-gel beads (chi-SiG)
Coating procedure was prepared according to a previously described protocol ( Adlim et al., 2021 ) with some modifications. White-silica-gel beads (28.8660 g) were soaked within 50 mL of chitosan solution (as prepared in Section 2.2) for 60 min at room temperature, then it was dried into the oven for 60 min at 40 °C (called the first coating) and denoted as chi-SiG. Next, the chi-SiG was soaked again within 50 mL of chitosan solution for 60 min at room temperature and dried into an oven for 60 min at 40 °C (as the second coating), then it was repeated until the third coating. The drying process was carried out until a constant weight was attained. Each step of the coating was characterized by using binocular microscope stereo and SEM. The three-time coated chi-SiG was then used further in the following experiments.

Immobilization of AgNPs on chi-SiG, which is then symbolized as AgNPs-[chi-SiG] was evaluated by observing the surface through SEM, and the particle size was evaluated by TEM. The SEM images of AgNPs-[chi-SiG] presented in Fig. 7 show that the surface was different from chi-SiG both at low and high magnification ( Fig. 6 ). Fig. 7 (b) showed the number of white aggregates with a size of ∼ 1–3 μm that might represent of AgNPs assemble. The aggregates are contrasting from the chitosan layer ( Fig. 8 b). Immobilized AgNPs on chi-SiG to form AgNPs-[chi-SiG] was confirmed.
After immersing AgNPs-[chi-SiG], the slurry was analyzed by TEM measurement, and the represented image is shown in Fig. 8 (a). The TEM image of AgNPs of AgNPs-[chi-SiG] was different from the colloidal chi-AgNPs ( Fig. 1 a). Unlike the colloidal nanoparticles, TEM analysis revealed uniformly spherical AgNPs with fine dispersion ( Fig. 8 a) and slightly larger particles with a diameter mean of 13.18 ± 6.9 nm ( Fig. 8 b). It is worth understanding that the antibacterial efficiency of AgNPs is strongly influenced by their stabilization on given support. The stabilizer prevents particles from agglomeration, which affects the biocidal activity. This study confirmed that AgNPs on chi-SiG are stable without precipitation, dispersed particles without excessive aggregation. The stability is related to the chitosan role in the composite ( Ranjani et al., 2019 ). The different sizes and shapes might correlate with the immobilization technique. AgNPs in colloidal (chi-AgNPs) was inside of chitosan matrix, and all AgNP surfaces were covered with chitosan solution. The different phenomenon occurs in AgNPs-[chi-SiG] sample. The Ag ions were previously impregnated on the surface of the [chi-SiG] (solid), then Ag ions were subsequently reduced to form silver metal nanoparticles (AgNPs). Such sequence preparation makes AgNP surface assessable for bacteria interaction. This finding verified the previous study of immobilization of chi-Pd/Au on titania ( Adlim & Bakar, 2013 ). Therefore, this stepwise-immobilization technique was confirmed as the appropriate method. This solid system also promises several advantages, including compatibility on separation, regeneration, storage, and lower cost. According to AAS data, the mean of silver weight in each granular of AgNPs-[chi-SiG] was 0.0135 mg or 0.4028 mg per gram of AgNPs-[chi-SiG] granular.
