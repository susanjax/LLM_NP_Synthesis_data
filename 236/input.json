Ag nanoparticlesâ€™ biosynthesis
AgNO3 solution (1 mM) was prepared in 1 L of distilled water. Aqueous and ethanol extracts of Dactyloctenium aegyptium (10 mL each) were then added separately into two flasks containing 90 mL each of 1 mM AgNO3 and left to incubate at room temperature

.The whole reaction was carried out in a ventilated laboratory at neutral pH.


The result of the morphology and composition of the biosynthesized nanoparticles are revealed in
