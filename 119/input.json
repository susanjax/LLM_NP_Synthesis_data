Preparation of LFL-ZnO
L. plantarum ZDY2013 was grown in sterile MRS broth at 37 °C for 12 h. Then, 1.6 mL of the culture was inoculated into 40 mL of MRS broth. The liquid following anaerobic incubator at 37 °C for 24 h and bacterial were removed by centrifugation at 9600 × g for 5 min, supernatant was considered as LFL for following synthesis experiments [26].

The synthesis process of LFL-ZnO is shown in Scheme 1. Briefly, [Zn(CH3COO)2]·2 H2O was dissolved in a solution comprised of 20 mL ethanol solution and 20 mL fermentation liquid, and sonicated (300 W) 10 min for the chelation of the zinc ions and biologically active substance in the LFL; After added NaOH to the solution to shift the pH to 12, the mixture solution was transferred into a microwave oven (Midea, 2.45 GHz, 1000 W) to illuminate and heat for 3 min, the white precipitate was obtained by centrifugation (2500 × g, 5 min) and washed with ddH2O and ethanol solution [21]; Finally, obtained the LFL-ZnO by vacuum freeze drying. For comparison, ddH2O was used to carry out the same steps as above and named as H-ZnO for the following analysis.

Characterization of LFL-ZnO
XRD analysis was used for determining the crystalline nature of LFL-ZnO in Fig. 1B. The resultant diffractogram showed the peaks at diffraction angles of 2θ (corresponding planes) equal to 31.769°(1 0 0), 34.421°(0 0 2), 36.252°(1 0 1), 47.538°(1 0 2), 56.602°(1 1 0), 62.862°(1 0 3), 66.378°(2 0 0), 67.961°(1 1 2), 69.098°(2 0 1), which is accordance with the standard card (JCPDS No. 36–1451) with hexagonal wurtzite structure [33]. Its crystallite size is calculated by Debye Scherer's equation [13]:
(1)D = Kλ / β cos θ

where λ is the wavelength of X-ray, K is the Scherrer constant (K = 0.9), β is the full width half maximum (FWHM) of the 100% peak, and θ is the diffraction angle. From the high-intensity peak at (1 0 1) plane of the diffractogram, the mean crystallite size of LFL-ZnO is 41 nm.

SEM and TEM revealed the morphological characteristics of LFL-ZnO. SEM micrographs showed the spherical shape of LFL-ZnO particles (Fig. S2A), and TEM images (Fig. S2B) displayed that spheres are surrounded by shallow shell which may because ZnO is wrapped in some substances. EDX spectra showed the elemental composition of LFL-ZnO in Fig. S2C, the Zn and O elements may be attributed to the ZnO, the O and C elements may be attributed to the LFL which demonstrates ZnO may wrapped by LFL.
