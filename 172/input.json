Synthesis of EB-AuNPs
Eisenia bicyclis MeOH extract (EB) was dissolved in deionized water at a concentration of 25% (w/v) to synthesize gold nanoparticles (EB-AuNPs). The supernatant from centrifuged EB samples (10,000 rpm, 10 min) was employed in the experiment. At 60°C, a solution of 1 mM gold (III) chloride trihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in deionized water, and the pH was adjusted to 9.0 using NaOH [39]. The EB sample (a total of 2 mL) was introduced drop by drop to see how the color changed. The visual observation of the color change from yellow to dark red wine validated the production of EB-gold nanoparticles (AuNPs).
Characterization of EB-AuNPs
Using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), we were able to determine the size distribution of EB-AuNPs. The average value of the size distribution was found to be 154.74 ± 33.46 nm (Fig. 2C). Through the use of zeta potential analysis, the total net charge that is present on the surface of the EB-AuNPs was examined, and it was shown to have a value of 34.43 ± 0.78 mV (Fig.2D).
The crystalline nature of the EB extract and EB-AuNPs was confirmed by XRD analysis (Fig. 3). The XRD spectra of the EB extracts showed peak intensities at 2θ values of 20.40°, 28.35°, 31.66°, 40.49°, and 45.40o.the XRD spectra of EB-AuNPs include peaks at 2θ values of 31.69°, 38.20°, 44.37°, 64.59°, and 77.54° respectively.
The XRD spectra of the chemically produced EB-AuNPs had values of 38.20°, 44.37°, 64.59°, and 77.54°, which are consistent with the presence of gold nanoparticles [39,54]. Similar diffraction peaks have been observed previously for AuNPs produced utilizing brown algae [52,55,56]. Field emission-transmission electron microscopy, also known as FE-TEM, was used to look at the morphology of the EB-AuNPs that were synthesized (Fig. 4). As can be observed in the pictures obtained by FE-TEM with resolutions of 100, 50, and 20 nm (Fig. 4A–C), the EB-AuNPs have the form of polyhedral particles. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) study was performed to evaluate the elemental composition of EB-AuNPs and to map their distribution (Fig. 4). The polyhedral form of the EB-AuNPs was further verified by the image taken by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) instrument during the EDS analysis (Fig. 4E). EDS spectra and mapping of Au using EDS were used to confirm both the existence of gold in the EB-AuNPs as well as their composition (Fig. 4E–G).
