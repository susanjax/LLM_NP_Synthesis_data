Synthesis and Characterization of AgNP
The kefir fermentation was performed at room temperature, for 48 h, where 200 g of kefir grains and 50 g of organic unrefined sugar cane were mixed in 500 ml deionized water. The water kefir fermented liquor was centrifuged (16,000 × g, 15 min, 4℃) to obtain a cell-free supernatant (Solution A). For the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles, 10 ml of Solution A were mixed with 0.01 g of AgNO3 (Sigma Aldrich), under ultrasonic agitation for 10 min. The AgNPs were stored under refrigeration (4℃) and protected from light until further use. The nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL JEM 2100) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and UV—Visible spectroscopy (Epoch 2 Biotech).
Characterization of AgNPs
AgNPs were synthesized by a biogenic process that uses kefir as described in Materials and Methods and characterized by TEM and UV/VIS absorption spectra (Figure 1). The diameter of a typical AgNP was about 20 nm.
