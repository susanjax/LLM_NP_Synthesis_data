Preparation of adsorbent
Using a hydrothermal technique, the desired composite was produced. To put it another way, equal parts of FeCl3 (0.01 M) and Na2S (0.05 M) were taken and aggressively mixed for one hour in a single beaker. Chitosan (0.2 g) in 100 mL aqueous solution in a different beaker, stirred for an hour. This mixer solution was then added to the beaker above, along with a little amount of vitamin C as reducing agent. The combined solution is poured into a stainless steel beaker lined with Teflon, sealed, and heated to 180 °C for 4 h in a furnace. Following the completion of the reaction, the mixed solution was allowed to cool to room temperature before being cleaned with water and ethanol. After filtering, the final product was dried in a hot air stabilizer for an entire night at 70 degrees Celsius. In absence of chitosan, the bare FeS2 were obtained using the same protocol.

Crystalline size and phase formation study
Fig. 1 describes the crystalline size and pure phase formation of prepared FeS2 and FeS2/chitosan composite through XRD (x-ray diffraction) analysis results. The single homogenous phase of FeS2, which corresponds to the cubic phase (JCPDS 00-042-1340) and displays pyrite crystal structure, is reflected in the diffracted peaks for FeS2 and FeS2/Chitosan composite. There were no other peaks found that were associated with chloride or any impurity phase, including troilite, pyrrhotite, or marcasite. The cubic structure’s lattice parameters were determined to be a = b = c = 5.4 Ao. The XRD pattern’s wide peaks attested to the material’s nanocrystalline structure. Using the Debye–Scherrer equation (kλ/β cosθ) where k is scherrer constant usually 0.9, λ is wavelength, β is FWHM and diffraction angle is θ, the average crystallite sizes of nanocrystals were calculated to be approximately 22 nm and 15 nm for pyrite and FeS2/Chitosan composite.
