Synthesis of HAp@ZnO/PDA composite NPs
The HAp@ZnO/PDA composite NPs were synthesized by following a mussel-inspired PDA coating and a facile in-vitro SBF mineralization process 
[34]
, 
[35]
. Since the discovery of the PDA-coating technique, it has been a well-studied procedure for coating any type of material 
[36]
, 
[37]
. Similarly, the SBF mineralization procedure is usually followed to grow HAp on the substrate and is a general methodology to predict the in-vivo bone bioactivity of a material by observing the apatite formation on the material surface

. Hereby, in this study, a certain amount of ZnO NPs was dispersed in 0.1 M aqueous tris-buffer solution and kept under gentle shake for 12 h. Afterward, dopamine solution (2 mg/mL) was added and shaken for further 12 h. The brownish ZnO/PDA NPs were then collected after washing with distilled (DI) water followed by centrifugation. As collected ZnO/PDA NPs were then dispersed in a modified-SBF (m-SBF) by 15 min sonication and incubated at 37 °C. The m-SBF solution was prepared by dissolving NaCl (1000 mM), KCl (5 mM), CaCl20.2 H2O (25 mM), MgCl20.6 H2O (5 mM), and NaH2PO4 (10 mM) in 2 L of DI water 
[40]
. After different hours (6, 12, and 24 h) of incubation, HAp@ZnO/PDA-06, HAp@ZnO/PDA-12, and HAp@ZnO/PDA-24 composite NPs were collected by centrifugation, washing with DI water, and freeze-drying processes. Here, HAp@ZnO/PDA-06, HAp@ZnO/PDA-12, and HAp@ZnO/PDA-24 NPs were prepared to study the effect of incubation time variable on their morphology, antibacterial efficacy, and cellular activities. Parallelly, ZnO/HAp (HAp growth on non-PDA coated ZnO) NPs were also prepared for the comparative study.

The digital images of pure ZnO, ZnO/PDA, HAp@ZnO/PDA-06, HAp@ZnO/PDA-12, and HAp@ZnO/PDA-24 NPs verified that the pure ZnO NPs (
Fig. 1
 A), a white ceramic powder, was changed to brown powder in ZnO/PDA NPs (
Fig. 1
B), providing visual confirmation of successful PDA-functionalization. Similarly, depicting the similar hue of the PDA, the HAp@ZnO/PDA-06 NPs (
Fig. 1
 C) was obtained as brown powder, while in HAp@ZnO/PDA-12 (
Fig. 1
D), and HAp@ZnO/PDA-24 NPs (
Fig. 1
E) the brown color was little bit faded. Similarly, for the comparative physicochemical studies, the HAp was grown directly on the surface of non-PDA functionalized ZnO, and as-prepared ZnO/HAp NPs (
Fig. SI-1
A) were obtained as a white powder. The PDA-functionalization and PDA-assisted HAp integration was studied by FE-SEM, EDX, and BIO-TEM analysis. The FE-SEM images (
Fig. 1
F-J) showed that the rod-shaped nanoparticles were abundant in all the nanopowders, which was distinct in the case of pure ZnO. The ZnO/PDA NPs showed some roundness in shape due to the PDA coating, which was clearer in high-resolution images of HAp@ZnO/PDA-06, HAp@ZnO/PDA-12, and HAp@ZnO/PDA-24 NPs (
Fig. SI-2
). While, ZnO/HAp (
Fig. SI-1B
) showed similar nanomorphology to pure ZnO. The EDX result shown in 
Fig. 1
(K-O) confirmed that O and Zn were present in pure ZnO NPs, and C, N, O, and Zn were present in the ZnO/PDA NPs. Similarly, C, N, O, P, Ca and Zn were present in the HAp@ZnO/PDA-06, and HAp@ZnO/PDA-12, but in the HAp@ZnO/PDA-24 NPs, the Ca was not evidenced in EDX analysis. The BIO-TEM image of pure ZnO (
Fig. 1
 P) exhibited nanorods (NRs) rich morphology, and as expected, after PDA functionalization, the ZnO/PDA (
Fig. 1
Q) showed clear PDA layer encapsulation. The measurement confirmed that the thickness of the PDA layer was about 20.18 ± 4.3 nm. A similar TEM result was reported by Tavakoli et al 
[33]
. Moreover, the HAp@ZnO/PDA-06 (
Fig. 1
 R) showed abundant attachment of HAp (pointed by arrows) on their surface. While on the surface of HAp@ZnO/PDA-12 (
Fig. 1
 S), the HAp particles were clustered and agglomerated (pointed by arrows) at several sites. Unexpectedly, there was no trace of HAp (as confirmed by EDX results too) on the surface of HAp@ZnO/PDA-24 (
Fig. 1
 T). Furthermore, the study of BIO-TEM image of ZnO/HAp NPs (
Fig. SI-1
D) showed very few HAp formation on their surface, suggested that the HAp integration was accelerated due to the PDA-coating on ZnO NPs.
