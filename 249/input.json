Green synthesis of ZnO-NPs
10 g of Dysphania ambrosioides dried leaves were macerated in 100 mL of deionized water for 1 h at room temperature without stirring. Then, the mixture was stirred for 2 h at 40 °C and 50 rpm. The synthesis was performed by mixing 20 mL of previously obtained extract (pH = 6.8) with 1.5 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and stirring for 10 min at room temperature (pH = 3.6) before being placed in a muffle for 1 h at the reaction temperature (200, 400, 600, and 800 °C). It was then removed from the muffle and allowed to cool at room temperature. The resulting powders from each synthesis were washed in triplicate with deionized water and allowed to dry at room temperature for 24 h (

) (

The diffraction patterns from all synthesized ZnO-NPs (
Fig. 2
b) showed the Bragg reflections indicated to ZnO (PDF #891397), 2θ values were 31.74°, 34.38°, 36.21°, 47.49°, 56.54°, 62.78°, 66.30°, 67.87°, 69.00°, 72.47°, 76.87°, 81.28°, and 89.50°, the reflections were indexed as (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0 ), (1 0 3), (2 0 0), (1 1 2), (2 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 2), (1 0 4), and (2 0 3) respectively. The ZnO crystalline structure is hexagonal with lattice parameters of a = b = 3.252 Å and c = 5.213 Å.

The average crystalline size calculated by the Debye-Scherrer equation (
Table 2
) showed that the average crystalline size increased as the synthesis temperature was higher.

ZnO-NPs	Average crystalline size (nm)
ZnO-NPs 200 °C	6.74 (±3.17)
ZnO-NPs 400 °C	10.10 (±2.68)
ZnO-NPs 600 °C	16.37 (±3.53)
ZnO-NPs 800 °C	29.53 (±5.90)

The FESEM images (
Fig. 3
) showed that the ZnO-NPs 200 °C were quasi-spherical in shape (
Fig. 3
a). Their particle sizes ranged from 4 to 10 nm, with an average of 7 nm. The ZnO-NPs 400 °C were also quasi-spherical in shape (
Fig. 3
b). The particle size ranged from 8 to 24 nm, with an average of 14 nm. The ZnO-NPs 600 °C (
Fig. 3
c) had two shapes: quasi-spherical and hexagonal prisms. The quasi-spherical shaped particle sizes ranged from 12 to 45 nm with an average of 22 nm, while the hexagonal prisms ranged from 20 to 100 nm with an average of 70 nm. Finally, the ZnO-NPs 800 °C (
Fig. 3
d) also exhibited two shapes, quasi-spherical and hexagonal prisms. The quasi-spherical shaped particle sizes ranged from 50 to 200 nm with an average of 130 nm, and hexagonal prisms ranged from 30 to 140 nm with an average of 90 nm. It was observed that, as the synthesis temperature increased, the size of the NPs was larger, and at 600 and 800 °C, a new shape appeared.
