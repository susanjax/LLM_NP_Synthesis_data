Preparation and purification of AgNPs
AgNPs were prepared with a single step reaction. Briefly, 42.4 mg (0.25 mmol, 1 eq) of AgNO3 was weighed and dissolved with 50 mL of distilled water. Then, 307 mg (1 mmol, 4 eq) of reduced glutathione (GSH) was added into the AgNO3 solution, and kept in ice bath for 30 min. 2.5 mM of NaBH4 solution was added dropwise to the above mixed solution at 0 ℃ with continuous stirring until the solution turned to reddish black. Finally, 1:1 vol ratio of the synthesized silver solution was added to absolute ethanol and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min, and then the supernatant was discarded and GSH@AgNPs were collected.

2.3. Preparation of AMP-coated AgNPs
AMP-coated AgNPs were also prepared with a single step reaction. Briefly, 4.24 mg (0.025 mmol, 1 eq) of AgNO3 was weighed and dissolved with 50 mL of distilled water, then 188 mg (0.1 mmol, 4 eq) of P-13 was added to the above AgNO3 solution, ice bathed for 30 min, and pH of the mixture was adjusted to 3.0 with 10 % acetic acid. Then, 0.25 mM of NaBH4 solution was added dropwise to the above solution at 0 ℃ with continuous stirring until the color of the solution turned to reddish black, then the solution was frozen, and vacuumed to dry and attained P-13@AgNPs.

In this study, glutathione and P-13 were applied as ligands to obtain GSH@AgNPs and P-13@AgNPs, respectively. GSH@AgNPs exhibited an absorption peak at 390 nm measured by a UV absorption spectroscopy, while the absorption peak of P-13@AgNPs appeared at 410 nm (
Fig. 1
a). The hydrodynamic diameter of GSH@AgNPs was determined to be about 6 nm, and diameter of P-13@AgNPs was about 11 nm (
Fig. 1
c). The measurements of zeta potential of AgNPs showed that P-13 altered the surface potential of AgNPs (

b). The TEM results showed the typical morphologies of GSH@AgNPs and P-13@AgNPs, and the sizes were consistent with the hydrodynamic diameters determined by the DLS method (
