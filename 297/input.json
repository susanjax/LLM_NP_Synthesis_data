The collected healthy and fresh Gymnema sylvestre leaves were thoroughly washed many times with doubly de-ionized water and dried in air. 20 gm of chopped leaves taken in 100 ml doubly de-ionized water was boiled at 60 °C for 30 min and then cool down naturally. The obtained leaf extract mixture was filtered by Whatman filter paper No. 1 and stored in air tight container at 4 °C for the synthesis process. 0.1 mM of aqueous silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution in 200 ml was prepared and the G. sylvestre leaf extract of 5 ml was added into the aqueous silver nitrate solution drop by drop. After the addition, the reaction mixture colour was turned slowly as yellowish brown colloidal suspension which apparently shows the reduction process of Ag+ ions into metallic Ag NPs by the contribution of phytochemicals of G. sylvestre plant extract. The colloidal suspension of reaction mixture was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min and then Ag NPs were collected from reaction mixture by Whatman filter. The collected Ag NPs were washed with ethanol and doubly de-ionized water and then dried at 100 °C for 2 h. This same procedure was repeated for the 10 and 15 ml extract volume.

To confirm the synthesized samples as Ag NPs, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) study was carried out with the diffraction angle (2θ) from 10° to 80°.
Fig. 1
b displays the XRD patterns of the samples prepared from different volumes (5, 10 and 15 mL) of Gymnema sylvestre leaf extract. From
Fig. 2
, it can be obviously seen that the diffraction peak was emerged at 38° for all the samples and is well matched with JCPDS file No. 04–0783, which is corresponds to (111) plane of fcc structure of Ag. At 5 mL extract, the particles are also grown along (200), (220) and (222) planes of Ag crystal indicating by the diffraction peaks at 45, 65 and 77, respectively. Thus, the lower extract volume can induce the reorientation of the Ag crystal. Besides, the synthesized Ag NPs are only having single phase structure and it is confirmed by the absence of diffraction peaks related to other Ag related compounds and bio-organic phase. When the extract volume is increased from 5 mL to 10 mL, the diffraction peak intensity decreases remarkably and also other diffraction peaks are almost disappeared. Thus, it can be observed that the increase in extract volume shows strong effects on the synthesis. Similarly, in the case of 15 mL extract, the diffraction peak intensity decreases comparably, but the FWHM increases considerably, this could be ascribed to degradation in the crystalline quality of the synthesized sample. Hence, as the increase in extract volume, the crystal sample degrades noticeable

The size and shape of the synthesized Ag NPs were studied using the TEM analysis and shown in
Fig. 3
a. The TEM image displayed that the synthesized Ag NPs are uniformly dispersed and having mostly spherical shape with the average size around 20–30 nm. This value is more consistent with the average particle size calculated by structural studies. The well dispersion of Ag NPs may be attributed to the presence of stabilizing phytochemicals in the Gymnema sylvestre leaf extract. The elemental analysis of the synthesized Ag NPs was performed by EDX. The EDX spectrum (
Fig. 3
b) exhibits a strong signal at 3 keV for silver with few weak signals which can be originated by the phytochemicals attached with Ag NPs (
Rajakumari et al., 2019
).
