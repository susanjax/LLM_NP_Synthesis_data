Synthesis and coating of silver nanoparticles
An altered Turkevich process synthesized bare AgNP (yolk) [25], a chemical reduction route. For this, precisely weighed silver-nitrate (1.5 mM) including double distilled water was incorporated along with tri-sodium citrate by using hot-water bath instrument and followed by stirring, purification, and collection of nanoparticles. To fabricate a shell on AgNP, an altered mode of “Stober” [3] was used. Already synthesized AgNPs were taken in concentrated form and kept for sonication along with ethanol, double distilled water, and ammonia. Thence, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added in droplets under uninterrupted stirring (400 RPM) on a magnetic-stirrer, further whole mixture was incubated overnight at room temperature. After the incubation period, a purification process was carried out. All of the above-mentioned methods are aforementioned in detail in our work [46]. Subsequently, prepared nanoparticles were subjected to spectroscopic and bioactivity studies.
SEM and EDX analyses were carried out to observe the morphology and elemental composition study. It was evident from the SEM analysis, that both nanoparticles were spherical, exhibited in Fig. 1(c)–(f). EDX investigation of the silver nanoparticles confirms the presence of silver in its spectral signal, shown in Fig. 1(g), and (h). Additional elemental tip-offs were also noticed in the spectra which were assigned to the presence of some other compounds.
Yolk-shell-based silica-coated silver nanoparticles are prominently used in the biomedical field aas well as bare silver nanoparticles for various biological applications. The present work narrates the synthesis and silica coating of metallic silver nanoparticles and investigates their antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancerous activity. Both synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by TEM, and SEM-EDX. The average size of silver nanoparticles was 50 nm, while after coating with silica, the average size of silica-coated silver nanoparticles was 80 nm. The nanoparticles' antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer properties were comparatively examined in vitro. Agar well diffusion method was employed to explore the antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) at different concentrations and antifungal activity against Candida Albicans. To understand the minimum concentration of both nanoparticles, we employed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test, against bacterial and fungal strains, which was dose dependent. We learned that bare silver nanoparticles showed high antibacterial activity, whereas silica-coated silver nanoparticles surpassed their antifungal capability over bare silver nanoparticles against Candida albicans. The anticancer activity of the as-prepared nanoparticles was executed in opposition to the prostate cancer cell (PC-3) line by MTT assay, which showed meaningful activity. Following this, flow cytometry was also effectuated to learn about the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells. The results of this study demonstrate the dynamic anti-cancerous, antibacterial, and antifungal activities of bare silver nanoparticles and silica-coated silver nanoparticles for a long-lasting period.
