Preparation of Pleurotus ostreatus aqueous extract and biosynthesis of TiO2NPs
The P. ostreatus fresh edible mushroom fruiting bodies were washed entirely in tap water to eliminate the dust particles. 15 g of P. ostreatus fruiting body was taken and thoroughly washed, and these small pieces of mushrooms were combined with 100 mL of distilled water and boiled for 15 min at 70 °C. After boiling, the aqueous extract is filtered using Whatman filter paper. 80 mL of a 5 mM TiCl4 solution is added with 20 mL of P. ostreatus aqueous extract and mixed with a magnetic stirrer for 15 min to produce a pink-color solution. For use in subsequent investigations, the synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles solution was filtered through a nylon mesh (Spectrum), then a Millipore hydrophilic filter (0.22 µm)

. For the biosynthesized TiO2NPs, the color intensity of the solution was measured at 360 nm and at various time intervals; a control setup was also kept without the P. ostreatus extract.
Characterization
The XRD analysis of biosynthesized TiO2NPs using P. ostreatus mushroom extract. The outcome of the results noted peaks at 2θ values of 62.67°, 36.29°, 54.51°, 69.48°, 27.47°, 43.21°, and 56.94° can be indexed to the (204), (101), (211), (301), (110), (111), and (220) respectively, proving the existence of TiO2NPs (

[21]
, the XRD of TiO2NPs produced using M. charantia extract revealed broad peaks at 37.79°, 48.03°, 55.06°, 62.10°, 68.75°, and 70.28°, 25.25°. Similarly, Jayaseelan et al.
[26]
 reported the A. hydrophila mediated (TiO2NPs) peaks at 62.8°, 75.1°, 37.8°, 69.5°, 54.5°, 25.3°, and 47.9°, indexing the planes 204, 101, 004, 116, 105, 215, and 200 respectively. To calculate the particle size, Scherrer's formula was utilized. The outcomes were compared to JCPDS No. 89–4202. The mushroom produces TiO2NPs with sizes that range from 20.2 to 60.6 nm, with an estimated average size of 35.1 nm.
FE-SEM and EDX analysis of synthesized TiO2NPs
FE-SEM studied the nanoparticles' size, shape, and surface morphology of the biosynthesized TiO2NPs. The biosynthesized TiO2NPs were generally spherical, distributed, and of a mean size of 20–50 nm, according to the FESEM data (
Fig. 2
a–f). Similarly, Hudlikar et al.
[25]
 reported that FE-SEM examination revealed that TiO2NPs generated using J. curcas extracts had a mostly spherical form. The present findings are consistent with earlier studies on synthesizing titanium dioxide nanoparticles employing M. arvensis, and SEM images revealed the aggregated nature of spherical shape NPs

. The EDX analysis was used to determine the purity and presence of the generated TiO2NPs. The EDX spectra of the synthesized TiO2NPs demonstrated the presence of Ti ion signals. Along with titanium, additional elemental signals, including carbon, potassium, and sulfur, were also seen (
Fig. 3
). It is assumed that the usage of mushroom extracts, which contain a variety of macromolecules, including proteins, may be the cause of the existence of additional elements' signals

. The metallic TiO2 nanocrystals in the current work showed high absorption spectra in the range of 4.1–5.1 keV. Similar outcomes have been noted previously utilizing various mushrooms, such as P. guajava and C. gigantea
