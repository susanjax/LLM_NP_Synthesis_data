Synthesis of metallic nanoparticles
B. ciliata extract was used for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles and silver nitrate (AgNO3) was used as a source of metal for synthesis of nanoparticles (BCAgNPs) according to the method as described by Zargar et al.,
[16]
. For this purpose equal volumes of silver nitrate (0.1%) and B. ciliata extract (1%) were vigorously mixed in the ratio of (1:1). The mixture was incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Change in color was observed by naked eye and later analyzed by UV–Visible spectroscopy. The obtained nanoparticles (BCAgNPs) were purified through centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, washed and dried in vacuum chamber (Vacucell) for 24 h at 35 °C.

In current study, nanoparticles of B. ciliata crude extract were synthesized and evaluated for their bound phenolic and flavonoids contents, antioxidant potential, cytotoxic effect and antimicrobial activity. Synthesis of BCAgNPs through bio-green method was identified when the color was changed to brownish upon adding BC methanol extract in AgNO3 solutions. Collective oscillations of free electrons of reduced BCAgNPs were responsible for change in color of the reaction mixture
[22]
. Further, UV–visible spectrophotometric analysis of nanoparticles showed the maximum absorption of nanoparticles at a wavelength of 425 nm (
Fig. 1
). The nanoparticles, BCAgNPs formed were spherical in shape as observed in the field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (
Fig. 2
). Average size of nanoparticles was found 35 nm as shown in
