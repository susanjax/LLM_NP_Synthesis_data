PAN (8% by weight) was dissolved in DMF. Solution was kept on stirring for 12 h at room temperature (25 ± 3 °C) and copper oxide was added and solution was kept on further stirring for 4 h. Solution was then loaded to electrospinning for nanofiber production. Electrospinning conditions were as follows: syringe capacity 20 ml, nozzle diameter 0.5 mm, Voltage was fixed on 13 kV, distance between nozzle and collector drum was kept on 14 cm, and flow rate of solution was 0.5 ml/h. Electrospinning conditions were kept same for all samples. Table 1 represents samples details.
Morphological properties of prepared nanofiber mats were observed by SEM analysis. It can be seen in Fig. 1 that prepared nanofibers are bead-free. All nanofiber mats had uniform morphology as well. It means that addition of CuO nanoparticles did not cause any beads formation or non-uniformity in PAN nanofibers.
Fig. 1(f) represents morphology of copper oxide nanoparticles. It was observed that copper nanoparticles were of spherical shape with an average diameter of 37 ± 9 nm. Spherical shape of copper oxide nanoparticles helps to boost antibacterial activity as it provides higher surface area as compared to that of nano-rods or other shapes. Dispersion of spherical nanoparticles is uniform which also exhibited a uniform and smooth release from PAN nanofibers.
XRD was done to confirm crystalline structure of nanofiber mats. Pure PAN nanofibers (Fig. 4) showed a sharp peak at 2θ = 17°, and a small peak at 2θ = 30°.while PAN did not exhibit any peak up to 2θ = 80°. PAN nanofibers showed characteristic peaks of pure PAN. First peak (17°) could be associated with hexagonal lattice of PAN. It was observed that characteristic peak of PAN was decreased after addition of copper oxide in to PAN nanofibers which clears that crystallinity of pure PAN was decreased and hexagonal lattice of PAN was broken meanwhile CuO exhibited its characteristic peaks at 2θ = 36° and 2θ = 38°, interestingly peaks intensity was increased with increasing copper oxide concentration in PAN nanofibers. Occurrence of CuO characteristic peaks imparted crystallinity to PAN/CuO nanofiber mats. It was also observed by tensile test that tensile strength of PAN/CuO nanofibers was increased with increasing amount of CuO in PAN nanofibers. Tensile strength has direct relation with crystallinity of polymers.
