Synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles from Opuntia humifusa
The harvested Opuntia humifusa fruits was washed with double distilled water and dried at room temperature. After that seeds from the fruit were removed. The flesh of the fruit was separated and it was crushed and weighed cautiously. Fruit extract was prepared from 20 g of Opuntia humifusa fruit powder was taken in a round bottom flask and it was shaken with 100 ml double distilled water for 24 h and heated in oven at 60 °C for 15 min. Light red color of mixture revealed that the fruit extraction has happened. The as prepared extract was filtered in Whatman No.1 filter sheet and also centrifuged. At last, the extract was stored in refrigerator for further analysis. To synthesize zinc oxide nanoparticles, precursor material of (0.1 M) zinc nitrate was gradually disseminated in 50 ml of double distilled water in mild rousing using magnetic stirrer. Subsequent to rousing process, 20 ml of Opuntia humifusa fruit extract was added drop wise to the above synthesized precursor solution and heated to 60 °C. Now the solution becomes white to yellow color and this change indicates the formation of zinc oxide nanoparticle. The final product was transferred into alumina crucible and the crucible was heated to 400 °C for 2 h in programmable muffle furnace for preparing the zinc oxide nanoparticles. The obtained final product was used for further characterizations.
Characterization
Herein, the powder X-ray diffraction studies have been carried out using Bruker AXS (D8 ADVANCE) X-ray diffractometer instrument operating at a voltage of 30 kV and a current of 30 mA with Cu Kα (k = 1.5406 Å) radiation and 2θ angle ranges from 10° to 80°. The recorded powder XRD pattern of the green synthesized ZnO nanoparticles have been depicted in 
Fig. 1
. The distinctive Bragg reflections at 2θ values of 31.70°, 34.37°, 36.23°, 47.50°, 56.60°, 62.98°, 66.26°, 67.93°, 69.10° and 72.56° can be indexed to the (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (2 0 0), (1 1 2), (2 0 1) and (2 0 2) planes, respectively by comparison with JCPDS card No.36-1451 that are in good agreement with zinc oxide hexagonal phase wurtzite structure

. The distinct and sharp diffraction peaks indicate that the product has a high purity and well crystalline particle structure. The mean crystallite size was estimated from the XRD line broadening measurement using Scherrer’s equation, D = Kλ/(βCosθ)

where K = 0.9 is the shape factor, λ is the wavelength of X-ray used (1.54 Å), θ is the Bragg diffraction angle, and β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) value of the ZnO (1 0 1) plane of reflection and θ is the Bragg angle. The estimated crystallite size of the attained ZnO nanoparticles is about 25 nm under our experimental conditions

The topographical images, crystalline size and shape of the resulting powder are determined using FE-SEM analysis by the Carl Zeiss microscopy instrument. From the micrograph images (
Fig. 3
 (a-d)) it is evident that they are in nanoscale range and have a smooth distribution with rod like structures. It is due to the occurrence of diverse groups of phytochemicals which facilitate in reducing and stabilising the nanoparticles during the synthesis procedure. In addition, less aggregation is observed which is especially similar to previous studies. Conversely, aggregation is also observed when the synthesis is carried out in aqueous medium and also possibly due to densification resulting in narrow space between particles

In wide-ranging, growth of ZnO nanoparticles is in diverse orientations such as:>v (0001) > v (0110) > v (0001) 
[9]
. Consequently, the growth formation of ZnO nanoparticles may be happened due to their preferential along (0001) direction. The mean length and diameter of the ZnO nanoparticles was found to be 700 nm and 51.42 nm, respectively
