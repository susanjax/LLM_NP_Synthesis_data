Synthesis of graphene oxide
Graphene Oxide (GO) was synthesized by modified hummer’s method through the conventional procedure. Typical procedure involves the addition of 230 mL of H2SO4 is added to 10 g pure graphite powder by keeping a constant low temperature with continuous stirring. 30 g of KMnO4 and 5 g of NaNO3 was then added gradually into the solution at the temperature of 10−15 °C till the solution becomes dark green. Later this was subsequently heated with continuous stirring at 350 °C for 30 min. The temperature was raised to 90 °C right after the slow addition of 250 mL of doubly distilled water to the above mixture. Then 500 mL of H2O2 was slowly added for 10 min to seize the effect of KMnO4. 100 mL of deionized water (DIW) was added and centrifuged using Eppendorf Centrifuge 5430R at 5000 rpm for 7 min. The washed GO solution was allowed to dry using an oven at 90 °C to collect GO powder. (

Synthesis of graphene oxide-nickle oxide
GO-NiO nanocomposite was prepared in two steps. In the first step, 20 mL of 0.2 mol/L NaOH solution was slowly added into a 20 mL of 0.1 mol/L Nickle acetate solution containing 0.004 mol/L of Triton X-100 with constant stirring. Then, 65 mL of deionized (DI) water was added slowly into the above solution with stirring to form Ni(OH)2. In the second step, a known amount of GO was dispersed in 20 mL of DI water via ultrasonication. To this solution, 1.2 mL of Ni(OH)2 was added. The solution was stirred for 1 h, and then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 150 °C for 6 h. The resulting black solution was cooled naturally to room temperature, and washed three times with DI water and ethanol. Finally, the product was dried in an oven at 60 °C for 8 h.
