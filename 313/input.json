Preparation of the treated PEEK materials
Disc-shaped PEEK (Ensinger, Nufringen, Germany) with dimensions Φ15 × 1.5 mm was used for surface characterization and in vitro biological assays, while cylindrical implants with dimensions Φ2 × 5 mm were prepared for rat femoral implantation in vivo. Prior to use, the samples were polished with abrasive papers and ultrasonically cleaned in anhydrous ethanol and deionized water for 15 min sequentially, and dried at 70°C.
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were obtained by reducing chloroauric acid (C805628, Macklin, Shanghai, China). More specifically, chloroauric acid (5 × 10−4 M) is mixed with Triton X-100 (1 × 10−2 M) in 40 mL deionized water, then reduced using l-ascorbic acid (3 × 10−2 M). The solution was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min, the supernatant removed, and 5 mL of deionized water was added to resuspend the pellet.
The functionalized PEEK surface was prepared by mixing metronidazole (M, B1976, APExBIO, American), AuNPs, and dopamine hydrochloride (D103111, Aladdin, Shanghai, China). Dopamine hydrochloride was added to a Tris-HCl solution (10 mM, pH 8.5, Solarbio, Beijing, China) at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. The AuNPs and metronidazole solution were added to 1.8 mL of dopamine solution to form a 2 mL mixed solution. Pure PEEK samples were soaked in the mixed solution with gentle shaking at 37°C for 18 h. Depending on the reagents added, the experimental groups consisted of PEEK(P), M/P, AuNPs/P, and M-AuNPs/P. The control group was pure PEEK. The PEEK modified with gold nanoparticles was named AuNPs/P, while the PEEK material modified with metronidazole was named M/P. The PEEK material modified with metronidazole and gold nanoparticles was named M-AuNPs/P. The treated samples were washed with deionized water for 5 min to remove unadhered species.
