Preparation of silver/silver chloride nanoparticles
To synthesize silver nanoparticles, 1 M stock solution of AgNO3 was prepared and added to the C. frutescens and T. indica extract to the concentrations of 1 mM, 2 mM, 3 mM, 4 mM, 5 mM and 6 mM. The mixtures were kept in sunlight for several time durations (15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min), and a dark brown color was formed. After optimizing the reaction time and observing the UV–Vis spectra of synthesized AgNPs, the final concentration of AgNO3 was 5 mM and the reaction time was 120 min. For the separation of silver nanoparticles, the solutions were centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 rpm. The removal of excess silver ions was accomplished by rinsing AgNPs precipitates. Finally, AgNPs solutions were prepared by dispersing nanoparticles in deionized water and storing the sample at 4 °C for later usage.

The structure and crystalline nature of the synthesized silver nanoparticles were studied by XRD analysis. Silver nanoparticles produced by the mixed extracts of C. frutescens and T. indica displayed four different diffraction peaks at 28°, 32.4°, 38.3°, and 46.4°, respectively (

A). These are corresponding to (111), (200), (111), and (220) planes, respectively, which indicate the development of the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure of AgNPs (
Dehghanizade et al., 2018
;
Namburi et al., 2021
). This analysis confirmed that at the primary stage of the reaction, AgCl could be formed due to the reaction of Ag+ and Cl¯ in the reaction mixture comes from AgNO3 and the phytochemical compounds in the aqueous C. frutescens and T. indica extracts respectively. The acquired XRD spectrum revealed that the synthesized AgNPs were in nanocrystal form when compared to the standard (
Gnanajobitha et al., 2013
). When the intensity ratio of (200) was compared to that of other diffraction peaks, it was determined that the (200) plane was the primary orientation in the silver crystal structure of the synthesized AgNPs.

The morphology of green synthesized silver nanoparticles was determined by Scanning Electron Microscopy. The presence of nano-sized metal particles was confirmed by SEM analysis and the formed Ag/AgCl-NPs were nearly spherical. In most cases, the plant-assisted silver nanoparticles were found to be spherical (
Ahmed et al., 2016
). The average particle size of the nanoparticles was obtained around 72.2 nm (

Konappa et al., 2021
).
