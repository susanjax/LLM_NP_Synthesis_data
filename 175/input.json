Silver nanoparticles synthesized from E. indica ethanol extract
In this experiment, a 1 mM solution of AgNO3 was prepared by adding AgNO3 to 10 mL of ethanol extract (500 mg dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol) in a clean 250 mL beaker. The mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 24 h to facilitate the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. Subsequently, centrifugation was carried out at 4000 rpm for 30 min to separate the settling layer containing the nanoparticles from the transparent liquid. The settling layer containing the nanoparticles was collected and transferred into a 5 mL vial specifically designed for artificial sections, ensuring proper labeling. Subsequently, the collected nanoparticles were dried in an oven at 30 °C. The resulting nanoparticles were identified as E. indica silver nanoparticles. (E. indica-AgNPs) [29].
Characterization of SEM analyzed of AgNPs andextract of E. indica synthesized
The characterization of SEM green synthesis of Ag-NPs using the ethanol extract of the plant Erythrina indica successfully transformed the catalysts into spherical-shaped nanoparticles with a size range of 25.4 nm (

). The Ag-NPs formation occurred at a nano-scale and included active compounds that were effective against microorganisms.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysized was theshowed to determine for the crystallinity and purity of the powder samples analysis revealed prominent reflection peaks XRD image at θ = 38.35° (111), 46.35° (200), 64.45° (220), and 76.83° (311) and the biosnthesized of observing lattice plane patterns suggests a face-centered crystal structure of silver, while unassigned peaks may arise from the crystallization of bioorganic phases on nanoparticle surfaces JCPDS card no. 01 087 1473 (
