Gold nanoparticles synthesis
Gold nanoparticles were obtained by using 5 × 10−3 mol L−1 HAuCl4 solution prepared from gold powder dissolution in aqua regia. Freshly prepared 0.02 mol L−1 NaBH4 solution (10 mL) (Vetec) was used as reducing agent. Chitosan (Deacetylated chitin, Poly(D-glucosamine)) low molecular weight, CAS Number 9012-76-4, Sigma-Aldrich, code 448869, Lot STBH6262) was employed as gold nanoparticle stabilizer. For this purpose, 75 mg of chitosan were dissolved in 10 mL of formic acid (10% v/v) followed by the addition of HAuCl4 (1 mL) and NaBH4. The resulting reddish color gold nanoparticles dispersion was assigned as AuNP-ch. In the next day, 0.5 mmol of APTMS (3-aminopropyltrimetoxysilane) (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%) was added to the AuNP-ch dispersion, under stirring, and it was named AuNP-ch-APTMS.

The TEM images clearly show spherical gold nanoparticles in both images. However, the gold nanoparticles are more agglomerated in AuNP-ch-APTMS dispersion when compared with AuNP-ch, i.e., in the AuNP-ch-APTMS dispersion the gold interparticle spacing is markedly smaller. This agglomeration results in a near-field coupling that can explain the red-shift observed in the UV–Vis spectra. The gold nanoparticle size distributions are presented on the right-hand side of

. The estimated average nanoparticle size in AuNP-ch dispersion was 3.97 nm with a standard deviation of 0.96 nm considering 558 particles. As for AuNP-ch-APTMS dispersion, the estimated average size was 3.99 nm with standard deviation of 1.03 for a population of 731 particles. Therefore, the average size of the gold nanoparticles can be considered as identical, with a diameter of 4.0 nm, with standard deviation of 1.0 nm.
