Green synthesis of Ag NPs
For the objective of the biosynthesis of Ag NPs using M. azedarach extract, 90 mL of AgNO3 solution (1 mM) obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, (USA) was mixed with 10 mL of M. azedarach extract. The mixture was continuously stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The progress of Ag NPs formation was monitored by observing the color change of the mixture, which transitioned from light green to dark brown, indicating the formation of Ag NPs. The solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. To purify the biosynthesized Ag NPs, the resulting pellets were washed 4–5 times with distilled water. As a result of the washing procedure, the color of the Ag NPs solution transformed into a dark purple hue, indicating the removal of any unbound materials in the solution. The final solution was stored at 4 °C in a dark place (Saod et al., 2024), (Jalab et al., 2021) (Fig. 1).
All peaks in the XRD pattern were indexed as a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure (JCPDS, file no. 4–0783) (Fig. 5). The XRD pattern showed the presence of the diffraction peaks corresponding to theta values of 38.2_(111), 44.3_(200), 46.21_(231), 54.8_(142), 57.4_(241), 64.5_(220), and 77.65_(310) (Meng, 2015), (Qaeed et al., 2023). However, the domain orientation of peak was found in the 38.2 (111) plane compared with the other peaks. No other defect peaks related to other compounds were detected, confirming the green synthesis of Ag NPs. Crystal size was determined using the Debye–Scherrer equation:
(1)D = 0.9λ/βcosθ
Where D is the crystalline size, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, β is the full width at half maximum of the diffraction peak, and θ is Bragg's angle. The size of the obtained Ag NPs was estimated to be 11.53 nm, consistent with the size of NPs in FSEM measurement.
SEM analysis shows the successful green synthesis of Ag NPs by including spherical nanoparticles throughout the entire sample, which are normally not visible in conventional synthesis methods (Fig. 6A). The ionic silver precursor concentration continuously depleted, and the number of Ag NPs increased. The anisotropic growth of Ag NPs was preferred over the nucleation of new nanoparticles, leading to the homogeneous distribution of particles (Gaussian destitution) with an average diameter of 13.6 nm (Fig. 6B).
