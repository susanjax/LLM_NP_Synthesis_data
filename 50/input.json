Green Synthesis of TiO2 Nanoparticles
To synthesize TiO2 nanoparticles in a sustainable manner, A. calamus leaf extract was used as a reducing and capping agent, and titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) was used as a precursor. To begin the synthesis, 2.5 mL of TTIP (0.05 M) was dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water while stirring constantly until a transparent solution was obtained. The blend was then prepared with 20 mL of leaf extract before being treated with aqueous ammonia at room temperature with constant stirring until the pH reached 7. The synthesized product was washed several times with deionized water and filtered using Whatman filter paper before being oven-dried overnight at 50 °C. The dry precipitate was pulverized with an agate mortar pestle and calcined in a temperature-controlled muffle furnace for 3 h at 600 °C. Chemical sol–gel techniques were also used to synthesize bare TiO2 nanoparticles [50]. For the comparative study, we have synthesized the TiO2 nanoparticles by the sol–gel (SG) and solvothermal (ST) methods. For the sol-gel process, 150 ml ethanol was mixed with 10 ml deionized water under constant stirring. Further, 9 ml TTIP was mixed in the above solution under constant stirring while maintaining the temperature at 85 °C using paraffin oil bath upto 4 h. After forming the gel, it was dried in the hot-air oven at temperature 60 °C. The calcination was performed for 3 h at 400 °C and the prepared sample was named as ‘SG’. Finally, the XRD technique was used to assess the phase purity and crystallinity of plant-mediated TiO2 nanoparticles.
Characterization of TiO2 Nanoparticles
Figure 3 shows the XRD pattern of biosynthesized and bare TiO2 nanoparticles. The spectra show the development of anatase-phase titania with diffraction angles (2θ) of 25.3° (110), 37.8° (011), 48.0° (111), 54.0° (121), 62.8° (310), 69.0° (031), 70.2° (112), and 75.1° (022). Our findings are very similar to those of the standard JCPDS File No (21-272). From the XRD spectra, a prominent peak at 25.3° and 48.0° is solely related with the TiO2 anatase (110) crystallographic plane without the presence of any impurities. Further, the XRD spectra of bare TiO2 were also provided for the comparison with the biosynthesized nanoparticles.
The hydrodynamic diameter of biosynthesized and bare TiO2 nanoparticles was precisely measured using particle size analysis. The mean particle size of biosynthesized and bare TiO2 nanoparticles was estimated to be 37.8 and 58.8 nm, respectively (Figure 5a).
