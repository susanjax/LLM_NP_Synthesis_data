Preparation of leaf extract
Young leaves of G. glauca were confirmed by using herbarium specimens deposited at plants and animal museum, Karnatak University, Dharwad (
Fig. 1). Leaves were cleaned a number of times and 20 g of leaves were weighed and diced into small pieces, which later transferred into sterile distilled water (250 mL) and agitated at 80 °C for 60 min on water bath for formation of aqueous leaf extract. This was sieved using Whatman No. 1 filter paper and filtrate was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant applied for synthesis of AgNPs.
Bio-synthesis of AgNPs
One mM AgNO3 solution was formulated by mixing 0.1698 g AgNO3 in 1000 mL of distilled water and used for AgNPs synthesis. The prepared plant extract and AgNO3 solutions were mixed in the ratio of 1:4 (v/v) in 1000 mL conical flask. The pH of reaction mixture was set at 8.5 and incubated in dark for 12 h. After the required incubation period the spectra was recorded with an UV–Vis. spectrophotometer. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm and acquired AgNPs were used for further analysis.

        Characterization of AgNPs
SEM micrograph displayed the AgNPs were spherical or oval shaped along with few polymorphic particles (
Fig. 4
D). The particles were poly-dispersed and few were agglomerated with a size ranged from 20 to 45 nm. A similar result was obtained by
Kumar et al. (2016)
, where the SEM result of Adansonia digitata fruit synthesized AgNPs revealed the spherical and poly-dispersed nanoparticles having size between 18 and 32 nm.
HR-TEM is a frequently used and valuable micro-imaging technique to access quantitative measures of nanoparticle size, shape, morphology and distribution of nanoparticles. HR-TEM images manifested spherical to oval shaped AgNPs as shown in
Fig. 4
F. All the particles were poly-dispersed having size ranged between 17 and 40 nm with an average size 27.30 nm. This was confirmative with the result of SEM analysis. This is in accordance with the result of
Rautela et al. (2019)
, where TEM images of Tectona grandis seed mediated AgNPs demonstrated spherical nanoparticles within 10 to 30 nm ranges.
The XRD spectrum indicated the crystalline nature and size of synthesized AgNPs. Four distinct diffraction peaks of 2ϴ angles were recorded at 38.15°, 44.28°, 64.50° and 77.45° and coordinated with JCPDS database of silver (file No. 04-0783) (
Fig. 4
G). These could be indexed at (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) Brag’s reflection of face centred cubic crystalline structure of AgNPs respectively. The average size of AgNPs was calculated approximately 26 nm using Debye-Scherrer equation. In addition to this there were few other distinct peaks in the XRD spectrum at 31.77°, 32.21°, 45.51°, 56.54°. The presence of these peaks might be due to the phyto-constituents or AgNO3, which might have not been reduced and hence gave rise to these peaks (
Rautela et al., 2019
,
Nayaka et al., 2020
). This result could be confirmed with the result of
Du et al. (2016)
.
