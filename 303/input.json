Synthesis of the NCD-functionalized magnetite nanoparticles
Uncoated and NCD-functionalized magnetite NPs were prepared by aqueous coprecipitation starting from analytical grade chemicals of anhydrous iron (III) chloride, iron (II) sulphate heptahydrate and sodium hydroxide and the natural chalcone dye (NCD). All chemicals used are of analytical grade. The NCD was added to the reaction mixture at appropriate pH values. In a typical experimental procedure, freshly prepared aqueous solutions of 0.4 M FeCl3 and 0.2 M FeSO4.7 H2O were mixed together in the nominal molar ratio of the stoichiometric magnetite, Fe3O4 (Fe3+/Fe2+ = 2). Then, a 0.4 M NaOH aqueous solution was dropwise added from a burette to the last mixture under a simultaneous heating and vigorous magnetic stirring. When an appropriate pH (∼5 for the sample designed by Magn_NCD5 and ∼8 for the sample designed Magn_NCD8) was reached, an appropriate volume of a chalcone solution corresponding to a nominal molar ratio chalcone/ by Magn (total iron ion) of 10% was quickly poured into the mixture. The addition of NaOH solution was continued until a pH value of ∼12 was reached. The obtained black suspension was subjected to additional heating/stirring for about 60 min. After natural cooling, the produced black precipitate was separated from its supernatant by magnetic extraction using a strong NdFeB magnet. The obtained wet precipitate was then washed/magnetically decanted several times by deionized water until a neutral pH was reached. Finally, the precipitate was stored in a polypropylene tube after oven drying at 70 °C. For a comparison purpose, a similar experimental procedure without adding NCD was followed for the preparation of the uncoated magnetite (hereafter abbreviated to as Magn).
The observed XRPD diffraction peaks are consistent with Bragg positions of the cubic spinel-like structure of the as-prepared iron oxides with no detectable extra peaks of other phases such as hematite and iron hydroxides [JCPDS#75–0033]. Additionally, relative to the XRPD peaks of Magn, a small shift of the XRPD peaks of Magn_NCD8 and Magn_NCD5 towards low angles can be observed (see the zoom-view around the most intense XRPD peak (2θ ≈ 35 ° in the inset). This indicates a relatively larger unit cell parameter of the last two iron oxides as compared to that of Magn sample. The value of the unit cell parameter of the three ferrites is given in
Table 1
. The calculated unit cell parameter of the as-obtained Magn_NCD8 and Magn_NCD5 ferrites is very close to that of the standard magnetite [8.396 Å: JCPDS#75–0033], whereas that of Magn lies between that of the standard magnetite and the Fe(II)-deficient maghemite [8.338 Å: JCPDS#39–1346]. The small shrinkage of the unit cell of the sample Magn can be interpreted by the formation of a magnetite/maghemite solid solution as reported earlier
[18]
. The bare sample (Magn) seems to undergo partial oxidation of Fe2+ ions (at least at the surface) to form the maghemite (γ-Fe2O3). Whereas, for the NCD-capped samples (Magn_NCD8 and Magn_NCD5), the well-known complexing/antioxidant effect of the polyphenols species is likely to simultaneously inhibit the oxidation of the ferrous ions and to favors the reduction to some extent of the ferric ions

. The XRPD peaks are clearly broadened, as the result of a reduced particle size. The estimated average crystallite size (<LXRPD>) using the Scherrer formula is 12.2, 4.9 and 10.5 nm, for Magn, Magn_NCD5 and Magn_NCD8, respectively. Selected TEM images with corresponding particle size histograms distribution are shown in

.
The as-dried powders consist of almost spherical (with few lozengic particles in the case of Magn_NCD8) nanosized particles. The average particle size (<DTEM>) inferred from TEM, for all produced powders are given in
Table 1
. Moreover, one can notice comparable values of average particle size as inferred from XRPD and TEM analysis, indicating monocrystalline nature of the produced NPs.
