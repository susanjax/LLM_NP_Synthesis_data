Biosynthesis of Silver Nanoparticles (AgNPs)
Ten mL of previous prepared Ulva fasciata aqueous extract was added slowly to 90 mL of freshly prepared 0.1 mm of AgNO3 with stirring and heating at 40°C for 30 mins until the color change to brown.37
Biosynthesis of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs)
0.02M aqueous Zinc acetate dehydrates was added to 40 mL distilled water in constant stirring. Then, 10 mL was added of algal aqueous extract after 10 min, stirring then 2.0M NaOH was added, stirring for 2hrs. The pale white precipitate was filtered and washed two times with purified water then by ethanol. Then, pale white powder of zinc oxide nanoparticles was obtained after drying at 60° C in a vacuum oven overnight.37,38
Characterization of the Biologically Synthesized Nanoparticles
The morphology and therefore the average size of the synthesized nanoparticles were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. The particles of Ag-NPs and ZnO-NPs biosynthesized are well separated single spherical particles in Ag-NPs, whereas rod-shape in ZnO-NPs without aggregation (Figure 2). The presence of the particles while not aggregation clearly insured the potency of the techniques utilized in the synthesizing processes. The common size of the particles was calculated and located to be 15 ± 0.55 and 187 ± 0.5 nm for Ag-NPs and ZnO-NPs, respectively (Figure 2).
Scanning Electron Microscopy The results obtained by scanning electron microscopy showed that the silver nanoparticles have a spherical shape, low-density dispersion, while the morphology of ZnONPs synthesis by the biological method was flake shape with a narrow size distribution (Figure 3)
X-Ray Diffraction Pattern Analysis The XRD pattern of nitrate treated sample shows 5 intense peaks in the whole spectrum 2 hrs starting from 10 to 60. The characteristic XRD peaks were focused at 28°, 38° and 45° that can be made by the subsequent crystalline planes of silver (111), (200) and (220), respectively. XRD analysis showed the diffraction peaks at that the indexed planes were concerning 111, 200 and 220 of the cubic face-centered silver. Whereas in ZnO-NPs the strong and narrow diffraction peaks indicate that the merchandise has a well crystalline structure. The XRD peaks at 32°, 35°, 38°, 48°, and 58° were known as (100), (110), (111), (200) and (310) reflections, respectively.
