Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles
In general, the green approach has been utilized to synthesize AgNPs. 
Fig. 2
 depicts a schematic illustration of the green synthesis procedure for producing AgNPs. To begin, a sufficient amount of silver nitrate (AgNO3) (10 mg) was dissolved in the de-ionized water (50 ml) in to the beaker. The beaker was covered with aluminium foil to prevent silver photodegradation. Simultaneously, to obtain the necessary concentration, a tiny amount of plant extract (PE) (5 mL) was dissolved in de-ionized water (50 mL). A drop by drop, the prepared plant extract was added to the silver nitrate solution and stirred continuously at about 500 rpm using magnetic stirrer at room temperature until the solution turns to golden brown in colour. The development of colour demonstrates the reduction and synthesis of AgNPs (golden brown). The complete formation of silver nanoparticles from the silver nitrate solution was completed within 10 min. The mechanism of silver nanoparticle generation is as follows.

Characterization of silver nanoparticles
To test crystallinity and phase purity, a few drops of the prepared samples (liquid form) were dropped on a glass plate (1 inch x 1 inch) and air dried at room temperature to produce numerous layers of films. The crystallinity of the produced films was determined using an x-ray diffractometer (XRD). 
Fig. 6
 depicts the XRD patterns of AgNPs. As can be seen in 
Fig. 6
, all samples have several crystalline reflections. AgNPs made from Seed extract, in instance, show two peaks (marked with $) about 37.6° and 43.8° (in 2θ), which correlate to the (111) and (200) crystalline planes of fcc structured AgNPs and match JCPDS card no. 04–0783. While AgNPs prepared with other extracts show crystalline peaks (marked with *) at 27.6°, 31.7°, and 46.05° (in 2θ), which are attributed to organic residues present during the synthesis of AgNPs, implying that organic phase crystallisation occurs at the nanoparticles' surface, which dominates the crystallinity of AgNPs. As a result, no peak that corresponds to crystalline AgNPs is seen within the XRD detection limit. In the AgNPs-Seed sample, however, the organic phase crystallisation is comparatively low in comparison to the increased crystallinity of AgNPs, resulting in AgNPs crystalline peaks dominating in the sample generated with seed extract. The average crystallite size of AgNPs were calculated using Scherrer's formula;
Where, k is the Scherrer's constant, λ is the wavelength of x-rays, β is the full width half maximum (FWHM) and θ is the Bragg angle. The estimated average crystallite size was found to be 19 nm, which confirms the formation of AgNPs by green synthesis.
