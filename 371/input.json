Silver nanoparticles synthesis by the bottom-up approach.
In this study, silver nanoparticles were synthesized by the green synthesis route of the bottom-up approach and methodology slightly different from the previous studies (Oves et al., 2018, Qayyum et al., 2017). Briefly, 250 ml of 0.1 mM aqueous silver nitrate solution containing bottle was cooled 2 h at 0 °C in the refrigerator. Separately, 250 ml of plant leaves extract containing beaker was placed on the magnetic stirring and drop-wise addition of cooled silver nitrate solution and monitor the reduction of Ag + ions into Ag0 at room temperature of 30 0C. The solution colour changed from light yellow to dark yellow and looking colloidal brown after the overnight incubation, and a UV–visible spectrometer was used to monitor these colour changes (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Japan). To avoid the precipitation of AgNO3, most of the solutions were made in ultra-pure chlorine-free water, and the reaction set was also equipped in the dark to prevent photoactivation. This reaction mixture was centrifuged three times at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. after centrifuge, the obtained pellets were collected and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 0C. This powder was sealed, packed in glass vials, and appropriately stored at 4 °C for characterization.
The XRD patterns of dried AgNPs have been analyzed, and the crystalline form of biogenic silver nanomaterials has been observed. The XRD indicates the number of peaks at 2 × 30°, 36°, 46°, 65° and 78° angles that could lead to the reflections of the 110, 111, 211, 222, and 311 lattice planes, which approximately matched the spherical shape of the silver nanomaterial crystalline structure (Fig. 3a). The other unsigned peak spectrum series was related to organic species' existence from the Conocarpus Lancifolius fruit extract. The analyzed data showed that the crystalline particle size was 22.5 nm in the mean diameter. The products' specific phase width is generally directly proportional to the average size of the crystalline substance. Broader peaks indicate the role of fruit extract in crystal nucleus growth and particle forming in our findings.
Electron microscopy was employed to detect the morphology of biogenic silver nanomaterials. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with the dispersive energy X-ray (EDAX) was used to observe the material morphology and elemental constituent material at a particular point. The SEM analysis obtained image at 1 µm scale and 10000 × magnification show that a very massive amount of particle aggregates parallel EDX was used to detect the weight wise 2.09 % silver role in nanomaterials remain other elements (Fig. 4 a & b). In this study, the particle size between 5 and 30 nm and spherical shape was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) depicted in Fig. 4c. The essential information at a particular point in the electron microscopy during sample analysis showed the nonmetallic residues confirmed biological moieties' involvement from the plant extract during the particle formation (Fig. 4d).
