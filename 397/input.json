Preparation of chitosan Schiff base (CSB)
1 g of chitosan in 100 mL of 2% acetic acid solution was stirred under a magnetic stirrer for 30 min to get a homogeneous solution. 1 mL of salicylaldehyde dissolved in 15 mL of ethanol solution was added to this solution. It was further stirred on the magnetic stirrer for another 30 min. A yellow gel of Chitosan-Salicylaldehyde Schiff base formed (Supriya Prasad et al., 2017). Then, the chitosan Schiff base gel was poured into a petri dish and allowed to dry for 48 h.
Preparation of CSB-Ag-NPs
0.2 g of prepared CSB was dissolved in 10 mL of double deionized water. To this solution, silver nitrate solution (0.05 g in 10 mL of ethanol) was added at 60 0C under magnetic stirring and the process was continued for 12 h. The color change was observed during the formation of silver nanoparticles, and it was confirmed by the formation of a brown color precipitate (Supriya Prasad et al., 2017). Then the precipitate was filtered and dried in a vacuum.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used for the analysis of molecular and crystal structures (Ali et al., 2022), qualitative identification (Ivanisevic, 2010), quantitative resolution (Cabral et al., 2013), degree of crystallinity (Dey et al., 2009), isomorphous, substitutions (Ananias et al., 2013) and particle sizes (Singh et al., 2013). Fig. 3 represents the XRD pattern of chitosan and CSB-Ag-NPs. For pure chitosan, the XRD pattern shows two peaks at 2θ = 9.9° and 19.8°, which tells about the semicrystalline nature of chitosan (Fig. 3). The XRD pattern of CSB-Ag-NPs revealed the orientation and crystalline nature of silver nanoparticles (Fig. 3) along with the amorphous nature of CSB. According to the literature, the 2θ around 38°, 46° and 54° corresponded to the face-centered cubic Ag crystals' (111), (200) and (210) crystallographic planes (JCPDS file No. 04-0783), respectively (Paulkumar et al., 2017). Similarly, for the PXRD profile of CSB-Ag-NPs, the 2θ values were seen at 38°, 46° and 54°, which corresponds to the presence of Ag-NPs with face-centered cubic structure, whereas the peak at 2θ = 27° related to CSB. Thus, the XRD analysis results confirmed the presence of silver nanoparticles in CSB with a face centered cubic lattice structure.
TEM analysis
Fig. 4 shows a TEM picture of CSB-Ag-NPs. The analysis confirmed the creation of Ag nanoparticles with spherical morphology and tiny aggregates, which ranged in size from 5 to 20 nm. The particle size determined by the Debye–Scherrer equation is supported by a TEM examination.
