Preparation of ACsupported bimetallic PdCo NPs
Herein, 10 g of C. verum herb powder was mixed with 100 ml of dH2O. The mixture was boiled in the microwave for 3 min. The plant extract was obtained by filtration through filter paper. dH2O was added to the extract at a ratio of 4:1. This plant extract was diluted by adding 32 mg of PdCl2 and 32 mg of CoCl2. AC was added at a ratio of 1:2 (weight: weight) to the metal total of the mixture. It was mixed at 395 rpm at 100 °C for 48 h and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm. After that, the resulting solid part was washed with 3 times with dH2O. At the end, the bimetallic NPs were dried in an oven at 45 °C (24 h)
Characterization of CoPd nanoparticles
Fig. 1 c shows the XRD graph of AC supported PdCo bimetallic NPs synthesized from C. verum by green synthesis. In the XRD spectrum seen in Fig. 1 c, diffraction peaks between 40° Pd (111) and 45° Pd (200) were determined for PdCo@AC. The diffraction peaks formed in the range of 40°–50° had an effect in observing matches with the face-centered cubic phase. In these ranges, the average crystalline size of PdCo NPs can be determined. Beam diffraction in the range of 20°–30° (000) was observed to depend on the presence of AC. The similarities between the results obtained and the reference articles examined were determined by comparisons ( Mora-Hernandez et al., 2014 ). Fig. 1 d shows the TEM image for the PdCo@AC NP. At 20 nm convergence, it was observed that the particles were generally distributed on the support structure and almost homogeneously. According to the results, the average particle size was found to be 2.467 nm. It can be said that the AC surface forms an ideal support form in the structure obtained ( Yoshii et al., 2017 ).
