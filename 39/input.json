Preparation of Gold NPs
Gold NPs were prepared by the reduction of tetrachloroauric acid with sodium citrate [51]. A 242.5-mL portion of 0.01% aqueous tetrachloroauric acid (Aldrich, USA) was heated on an MR 3001 magnetic stirrer (Heidolph, Germany) in an Erlenmeyer flask fitted with a water-cooled reflux tube. This was followed by the addition of 7.5 mL of 1% aqueous sodium citrate (Fluka, Switzerland) to the flask. The mean particle diameter (16 nm) was controlled by spectrophotometric calibration [52].
