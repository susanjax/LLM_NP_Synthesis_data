Catalyst synthesis
To decorate Ag nanoparticles on a WO3 surface, the deposition-precipitation method was used (Scheme 1). Typically, 3 g of WO3 was first ultrasonically dispersed in a 100 ml mixture solution containing ultrapure (UP) water and absolute ethanol with a volume ratio of 1:1 for 15 min in a 250 ml beaker. 0.01 g CTAB and a certain amount of AgNO3 were dissolved in 20 ml UP water, and absolute ethanol with a volume ratio of 1:1 was added to the resultant solution under vigorous stirring; the stirring was continued for another 30 min. After that, 25 ml of 0.05 M l-ascorbic acid was added into the above solution and left stirring for 1.5 h. Consequently, Ag nanoparticles are deposited on the WO3 surface. The product was collected by vacuum filtration and then dried for 24 h at 60 °C after washing several times with UP water and absolute ethanol. Ag/WO3 was obtained by calcining at 300 °C in the air for 1 h using a muffle furnace to remove undesirable substances. For comparison, Ag/WO3 was synthesized without calcination treatment.
The crystalline microstructure of synthesized Ag/WO3 samples was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (XPERT PRO), using the Cu Ka wavelength of 1.5405 Å, as shown in Fig. 1. The observed XRD pattern of the Ag/WO3 photocatalyst reveals that the sample has the three most substantial well-defined diffraction peaks centered at 2θ = 23.25, 23.913, and 24.3), confirming the presence of monoclinic crystal structure with d-spacing 0.38, 0.364, and 0.360 nm, the (002), (020), and (200) refractions, respectively. However, the diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic silver Ag0 or silver oxides Ag1+ are not observed, suggesting the presence of a very small silver particle size (2–5 nm) [32]. The XRD analysis revealed that all peaks matched perfectly with the diffraction lines for the monoclinic tungsten oxide (JCPDS 43–1035) [31], and no silver peaks according to (JCPDS 04–0783) were found in the XRD pattern other than impurity peaks. Moreover, a slight peak shift was observed for lower 2θ which could indicate the presence of small (<3 nm) and well-dispersed Ag nanoparticles that could not be detected due to the XRD detection limit (<3 nm).
HRTEM results are depicted in Fig. 3. It is clearly shown that the irregular shape and size of particles with the majority of WO3 particles exhibit sheet-like morphology with a size larger than 500 nm and very few spherical particles about 150–200 nm. HRTEM revealed that the Ag nanoparticles are composed of highly dispersed and tiny silver nanoparticles (<3 nm), and large Ag particles with the size of 3–10 are anchored and dispersed on the WO3 surface nanosheets [30], as shown in Fig. 3(a and b). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 3(c))was performed to confirm the existence of Ag in WO3 further, which clearly showed the existence of a combination of the spots, as observed in Fig. 3 (c), where the more substantial spot is attributed to underlying crystalline WO3, confirming the presence of well-crystallized Ag particles [31]. These results complement the XRD results. The analysis of HRTEM images Fig. 3(d–f) confirms that the lattice fringe spacing of Ag-doped WO3 is 3.8 nm for crystal plane [020] [23] and 3.64 nm for the crystal plane [002], corresponding to the lattice planes of WO3 with the monoclinic structure [32].
