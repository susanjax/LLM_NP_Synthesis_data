Synthesis and characterization of AuNPs
Tetrachloroauric (III) acid trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O, 99.5%), was gained from Sigma Aldridge. Firstly, DESs was prepared. Green synthesis of AuNPs was synthesized from aqueous gold ions (5 mL of 10−3 HAuCl4). Then, DES extract (30 mL), 30 mL of solution were proportionally mixed in a 250 mL flask. The AuNPs was synthesized by heating mixes at 65 °C during 45 min. The synthesized AuNPs were initially analyzed by Hitachi U-2900 UV–visible spectrophotometer at a spectrum range of 200–800 nm. Measurements were performed using a cuvette with a 1 cm path length. The FTIR spectra were recorded using Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer at a spectrum range of 400–4000 cm−1. Sixteen scans were summed for each acquisition. The electric charge on the surface of the AuNPs was assessed using the HORIBA SZ-100 Ver2.20 Malvern instrument. The size and surface morphology were observed using a scanning electron microscope (Tescan Vega 3) [22]. For this purpose, a drop of the colloidal system was placed on a copper plate with a carbon coating and photographed at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. The quantitative elemental evaluation of the AuNPs synthesized was ascertained by EDX analysis.
The location of the SPR absorption band observed in the synthesized AuNPs aligns with findings reported by various research groups in the context of AuNPs synthesis. The morphological investigation revealed both spherical and irregular shapes of the AuNPs (Fig. 6).
