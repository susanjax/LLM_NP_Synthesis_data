Synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles
In a typical experiment, a 0.01 M precursor solution of iron nitrate was prepared with double-distilled water and stirred well using magnetic stirrer for 30 min. Freshly prepared S. cordifolia extract was used as a reducing agent and stabilizer. For the green synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles, the aqueous precursor solution was kept under uniform stirring and boiled at 60 °C for 5 min. 5mL of S. cordifolia extract was added to 10 mL of boiled precursor solution under continuous stirring. The precursor solution turns deep brown and precipitate was formed after addition of S. cordifolia extract. To ensure homogeneous reaction, this process has been done under continuous stirring. The collected precipitate solution was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min with acetone, ethanol and DI water repeatedly. The dried precipitate powder was annealed at 300 °C for 8 h to obtain deep red colored α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles.
Characterization of iron oxide nanoparticles
XRD pattern of S. cordifolia extract mediated iron oxide NPs revealed the diffraction peaks at 24.20°, 33.19°, 35.68°, 40.87°, 49.52°, 54.10°, and 64.00°, respectively indexed to (012), (104), (110), (113), (440), (024), (116) and (300) planes of the rhombohedral hematite phase of magnetite nanoparticles (α-Fe2O3) (JCPDS 89-0599) (Fig. 5a). There is no trace of additional planes observed from XRD pattern, which indicates that the green synthesized α-Fe2O3 NPs were obtained with high purity at low temperatures. The calculated crystallite size calculated via Debye-Scherrer formula for predominant plane (104) of green synthesized hematite nanoparticles was about 18 nm. Further, we have calculated the crystallite size using Williamson-Hall plot (Fig. 5b) and was about 15nm [23].

The surface morphology of the green synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles was analyzed initially by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 6a, the SEM images of the α-Fe2O3 have shown the formation of spherical nano clusters, which contain a large number of smaller nanoparticles that are attributed from the aggregation of the nanoparticles. The elemental composition of the synthesized nanoparticles was evaluated by EDS analysis. The result indicated that the nanoparticles hold about 39.37% of iron and 60.63% of oxygen (Fig. 6b), which indicated the purity of the formed hematite phase of nanoparticles. For further confirmation of size and morphology of the green synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles, TEM analysis has been done and is shown in Fig. 6c and d. The TEM images revealed asymmetric morphology with uniform dispersion during formation of hematite phase. The particle size of hematite nanoparticles was 10–22 nm with an average size of 16 nm, which was predicted from XRD analysis using Debye-Scherrer formula and Williamson-Hall plot. The measured interplanar spacing distance was 0.27 nm. HRTEM image (Fig. 6d) found to be in match with (104) plane of hematite phase.
