Synthesis of CFO NPs
Solution 1 was prepared as follows: 1.48 g Co(NO3)2.6 H2O and 4.11 g Fe(NO3)3.9 H2O were dissolved in 20 mL double distilled water by magnetic stirring. Solution 2 was prepared by dripping 0.5 mL oleic acid (OA) into 50 mL of the 1 M NaOH solution at room temperature, then heating to 80 °C and stirring vigorously stirring for another 30 min. Solution 1 was added dropwise into solution 2, followed by vigorously stirring for 60 min. The final solution was coolled to room temperature, the precipitate was washed by distilled water until neutralization with assistance of a magnet and then was dried at 55 °C to obtain the dried powder, denoted as CFO@OA.

1 g CFO@OA was dissolved in 5 mL n-hexane, the solution was transfered to a ceramic bow l .4 g CA was added, after that the mixture was ground for 45 min (until n-hexane completely evaporated), the water was added to dissolve the mixture, which was transferred back to the cup and rinsed a few times with ethanol and distilled water and then was precipitated and dried to obtain CFO@CA.

The CFO@OA sample manufacturing process is shown in the diagram (

characterization
Fig. 2
 displays the XRD patterns of six samples including CFO, CFO@OA, CFO@CA, CFO-600, CFO@OA-600, and CFO@CA-600. All the diffraction peaks of six samples can be indexed on the basic structure of CoFe2O4 spinel ferrite (JCPDS No.22–1086)
[25]
. No impurity phase is detected in all the samples. Because the annealed temperature (600 °C) was larger than the ignition temperature of OA and CA, the CFO@OA-600 and CFO@CA-600 samples become uncoated samples of CFO NPs. As can be seen in
Fig. 2
, in the terms of the narrowness and sharpness of diffraction peaks, the order for all samples is CFO-600 < CFO@CA-600 < CFO@OA-600 < CFO < CFO@OA < CFO@CA. Interestingly, the uncoated samples had the narrower and shaper peaks as compared with coated samples, which led to the smaller crystallite sizes for the CFO@OA and CFO@CA samples. These differences can be explained by the inhibition of OA
[21]
 or CA surfactant on the nanoparticle agglomeration in the co-precipitation method. As a result, the crystallite sizes (DXRD), which were determined by Scherrer formula
[26]
, were 38.7 nm, 28.2 nm, 27.4 nm, 16.3 nm, 14.5 nm, and 12.4 nm, corresponding to CFO-600, CFO@CA-600, CFO@OA-600, CFO, CFO@OA, and CFO@CA samples, respectively. The crystallite size of four uncoated samples of CFO NPs was larger than that of CFO@OA and CFO@CA samples, which indicated the effect of significantly reducing the nanoparticle size of surfactants.

The morphology of the prepared CFO samples was examined by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) (
Fig. 4
).
Fig. 4
 reveals that all the synthesized samples are quite homogeneous in shape. The average size of the CFO, CFO-600, CFO@CA, and CFO@CA-600 samples are respectively about 15, 40, 19, and 30 nm, which is a little bit larger than the result determined by the Scherrer formula. The uncoated CFO NPs has a tendency to be in the state of clustered particles, while the coated CFO NPs does not, and it has much smaller particle size than the uncoated particles. This assertion is more clearly demonstrated through TEM images in
Fig. 4
(c) and 4 (d). From the 4 (d) picture, it is clearly that all CFO NPs are covered by the CA shell. The morphology of these CFO@CA was generally the same which shows a core–shell like structure. The dark part (black color) of the CFO@CA is the CFO core and the CA shell is the light part (gray color).
