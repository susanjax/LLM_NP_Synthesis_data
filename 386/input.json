Ag NPs are biosynthesized via the GBPE
Silver ions were reduced by mixing 5 mL of aqueous GBPE with a 0.005 M AgNO3 solution from Sigma-Aldrich. When kept in the dark, the combination solution changed color over 3.0 h, from colorless to dark brownish. The observed hue change implies that Ag NP was bio-reduced to silver ions. Fig. 1 depicts the Ag NPs synthesis schematic and color changes.

In Fig. 3, four distinct diffraction peaks were observed in the XRD analysis at angles of 38.21°, 44.38°, 64.53°, and 77.48°. Peaks matched crystallographic planes (111), (200), (220), and (311) in face-centered cubic silver [6,11,13,24]. The results aligned well with JCPDS database file No. 65–2871 [11,25].
Plant extracts offer a means to control the levels of agents involved in capping, reducing, and stabilizing, thus influencing the size and shape of metallic NPs [41–43]. Interestingly, during the synthesis process, the extract played a dual role by functioning both as a capping agent and a reducing agent. This dual functionality played a crucial role in preventing excessive aggregation of nanoparticles, and ensuring their long-term stability. Fig. 7(a–d) represents the high-resolution FESEM, TEM images, and particle size distribution. The image indicates that the Ag NPs have a spherical shape, although some also exhibit irregular forms. To assess the size distribution of the Ag NPs generated, an analysis was carried out using ImageJ software. The results indicate that the average particle size is approximately 55.12 nm from FESEM images and around 56.12 nm from TEM images.
