Identification and Sample preparation
This medicinal plant, Rumex hastatus, was taken from Kotli Sattian, located in Rawalpindi District and was identified with the services of plant taxonomists Prof. Dr. Mushtaq Ahmad and Dr. M. Zafar, Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid I Azam University, Islamabad. A voucher specimen (RHH-84) was submitted at Herbarium of Pakistan (ISL) for future records. Sample powder 100 g was extracted by with 100 mL of each solvent (Methanol and Water) separately (
Gul et al., 2017
).

For the synthesis of silver oxide nanoparticles, a solution of 20 mM (40 mL) AgNPs was added in a 200 mL beaker with aqueous plant extract (40 mL) and subjected to heating by ultrasonic bath for 2 h with continuous stirring. Then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min. The greyish-colored pellet was then subjected to hot air drying for 6 h in the oven (65 °C) and calcinated in Muffle-furnace (500 °C) for 2 h.

 Characterization of RH-AgNO3
The change observed in the color of the reaction mixture during the process indicates the synthesis of nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction (XRD) provides spectra to comprehend the crystalline structure of NPs. The diffraction configuration of RH-AgNPs is represented in (
Fig. 1
) and displayed four fine peaks at 2θ values of 38.15, 44.25, 64.4 and 77.5 corresponding to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) plane. The average size of RH-AgNPs crystallite was 32.18 nm obtained from all projecting peaks (20.34–54.67 nm).
FT-IR analysis of RH-AgNPs showed several bands that specify functional groups of biological molecules being adsorbed on NPs (
Fig. 2
). FT-IR spectra illustrated peaks between 500 and 4000 cm−1 and absorption peaks were observed corresponds to OH, Nsingle bondH, SH, Cdouble bondC, Cdouble bondO, Nsingle bondH bending, COOH and Csingle bondOsingle bondC. SEM analysis confirmed the structure and morphology of RH-AgNPs (
Fig. 3
a and b). RH-NPs were agglomerated, relatively spherical shaped, and image magnification ranged from 1 µm to 500 nm with a size of 77 nm. EDX images confirmed RH-AgNPs existence with the depiction of strong peaks. EDX analysis revealed the presence of silver (58.66%) and also some other elements, i.e., O, C, Cl, Fe, K, P and Ca (
