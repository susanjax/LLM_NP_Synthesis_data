 Green synthesis of CeO2-NPs
CeO2-NPs were synthesized by biosynthesis process (reduction, nucleation and stabilization steps)
[31]
, where 50 mL of Cerium III Nitrate Hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O – Sigma-Aldrich) (0.1 mol L−1) were mixed with the M. recutita extract (150 mL) under magnetic stirring (300 rpm / 120 min) for reduction and nucleation steps. After, the sample was filtered (ϕ = 12.5 cm), dried (333.15 ± 2 K around 24 h) for the stabilization step, and calcined (873.15 ± 2 K / 3 h). The preparation steps are shown in

Characterization
 Fig. 3
 shows the crystalline planes of CeO2-NPs, where it was possible to verify corresponding diffracted planes of cerianite photoactive (CeO2 – COD 9009008) with characteristic peaks and interplanar planes at 28.47° (1 1 1), 32.77° (2 0 0), 47.33° (2 2 0), 56.27° (3 1 1), 59.04° (2 2 2), and 69.048° (4 0 0) denote a cubic type structure (a = 5.41 Å, b = 5.41 Å and c = 5.41 Å)

. Furthermore, the average crystallite size was 16.36 nm for the chosen ideal condition of biosynthesis, due to the lower value and with considerable yield. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the average crystallite size was similar to that found in the literature

 Fig. 5
 shows the FEG-SEM micrographs with 50, 100 and 150 kx (a), (b), (c), respectively, and distribution of the particle size curve (d), where it was possible to verify a spherical morphology with an average particle size of 12 nm.
Fig. 5
 shows that CeO2 NPs tends to form large aggregates nanostructures, however, their primary nanoparticles are very small. Thus, CeO2-NPs biosynthesis produces spherical nanoparticles around 0–60 nm due to the calcination temperature (673.15 K) used
[66]
. It is worth mentioning that NPs reduced with extracts exhibited a larger particle size and a high level of toxicity for bacterial cells, whereas NPs from biopolymers demonstrate a smaller particle size and do not have a cytotoxic effect on human cells

. Thus, the CeO2-NP biosynthesis was confirmed correlating the characterization techniques (XRD, ATR-FTIR, N2 porisometry, ZP and FEG-SEM).
