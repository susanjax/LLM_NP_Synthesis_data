Preparation of Fe3O4/Malva sylvestris nanoparticles
All of the materials utilized in this investigation like Ferrous(ІІ) Sulfate Heptahydrate (FeSO4.7H2O), Iron(III) Chloride Six hydrate (FeCl3.6H2O) and Ammonia solution were purchased from Merck Co. (Germany). First, 4.75 g FeCl3.6H2O, 3.89 g FeSO4.7H2O, and 320 mL deionized water were poured into a round-bottom flask and stirred for 1 h while the temperature was set to 80 °C [1,2]. Then, 0.5 g Malva sylvestris was ultrasonically mixed in 120 mL of deionized water for 30 min and then poured into the previous suspension. The obtained suspension was stirred under 80 °C for about 2 h and after that 40 mL NH3 was gradually added to the suspension [3]. After filtration, the suspension was washed and the pH scale was set on 7 and finally dried in an oven at 100 °C for 2 h.
The experimental data on cytotoxic and antibacterial activity of synthesized Fe3O4 nanoparticles using Malva sylvestris are reported in this dataset. To validate the successful synthesis of Fe3O4 nanoparticles using Malva sylvestris, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was applied to determine the functional groups in the nanoparticles (Fig. 1a). The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis is depicted in Fig. 1b. SEM images and EDX analysis of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and Fe3O4/Malva sylvestris nanoparticles are presented in Fig. 2.
