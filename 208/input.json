Preparation of Ag NPs and Ag/rGO nanostructures
Co-precipitation method was adopted to establish cubic edifices of chemically synthesized silver nanoparticles. For half-hour, 0.1 M AgNO3 was blended in 50 mL of DD·H2O with constant stirring. The acidity levelsubsequently maintained between 7 and 11 by supplementing 0.2 M of NaOH to the translucent AgNO3 mixture. The obtained color of the solution was light brown, indicating that Ag was reduced. Following filtration, the obtained solution was rinsed with DD·H2O to eliminate any leftover contaminants. The ultimate outcome was dehydrated at 80 °C for 8 h to construct chemically made Ag NPs (C-Ag NPs). Conversely, new and nutritious sida acuta foliage was picked from the garden and rinsed three times with tap water and once with DD·H2O water. 10 g of finely chopped leaves were boiled in 50 mL of DD·H2O for 20–30 min at 40–50 °C. The acquired leaf extract was then sieved through Whatmann No.1 filter paper. Similar procedure was followed except the addition of 10 mL of aqueous sida acuta leaf extract solution for green mediated AgNPs(G-AgNPs). For the fabrication of the Ag/rGO nanostructures, rGO was generated from modified Hummer's technique
[22]
 through diminishing graphene oxide (GO) with KMnO4. The reduction process was covered in the following chemical reaction

5 mg of rGO was dispersed separately to DD·H2O (10 mL) and added to synthesize AgNPs.Subsequently, the C-Ag NPs@rGO and G-Ag NPs@rGO solutions were subjected to ultrasonication for 30 min and dehydrated at 80 °C.

he crystalline arrangement and structure of the produced samples were ascertained by powder X-ray diffraction analysis (PXRD). The PXRD patterns of C-Ag NPs, C-Ag NPs@rGO, G-Ag NPs and G-Ag NPs@rGO composites are depicted in
Fig. 1
(a). The C-Ag NPs, C-Ag NPs@rGO explicit monoclinic structure, which included Ag with leaf extract, G-Ag NPs and G-Ag NPs@rGO composites, demonstrated a face-centered cubic structure that was consistent with standard JCPDS cards No.40-1054 and No.65-2871. Fine sharp peaks were produced at 2θ values 18.86°, 20.15°, 32.05°, 33.66°, 37.89° and 39.49° for chemically synthesized Ag NPs, which coincided with corresponding diffraction peaks (011), (020), (002), (031), (112) and (121) respectively. The detected peaks reach its highest intensity at 2θ values 38.04°, 44.24°, 64.38°, 77.34° and 81.48° are attributable to the bio-reduction of Ag nanoparticles in the vicinity of leaf extract, which is closely aligned with the planes (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) for green produced Ag NPs

. The composite formation of rGO on pure Ag undergoes cubic nature change to face centered cubic structure. The minor hump region obtained at 2θ (28.76°) for G-Ag NPs@rGO generated using diffraction plane (002) exhibits recovered graphitic moiety, indicating reduction of rGO from graphene oxide. All the standard planes (hkl) of chemically and ecologically mediated Ag NPs exhibited a monoclinic and face-centered cubic structure of Ag NPs, in accord with the literature
[26]
. No other crystalline phases were detected in green mediated Ag NPs, indicating the purity and presence of leaf extract in the Ag nanoparticles without any alteration in the face centered cubic arrangement of Ag nanoparticles matched the EDX findings.The mean crystallite size of produced Ag nanoparticles was computed using the Debye Scherer equation,

Where 'k' is the Scherrer coefficient (0.94), 'λ' is the wavelength of X-ray radiation, 'β' is the half width at half maximum, 'θ' is the diffraction angle. The mean crystallite sizes of prepared samples were determined as61.14, 57.78, 22.9 and 23.0 nm. Green synthesized Ag composite has reduced grain size when compared with chemically synthesized Ag composite in co-precipitation method because the former uses environmentally friendly, biogenic materials as reducing or capping agents for the silver nanoparticles that are synthesized. These biogenic agents produce smaller particles because they are able to interact with the silver ions better than traditional chemical reducing agents. This interaction helps to reduce the growth of the silver nanoparticles, thus leading to a smaller particle size. The planes of diffraction, grain magnitude, micro strain and dislocation concentration for the corresponding diffraction peaks are depicted in the

Morphological analysis
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) magnified pictures were recorded to determine extern form of surface morphology, contour and dimension of Ag NPs and Ag NPs with rGO composite using sida acuta leaf extract.
Fig. 4
(a-b) depicts higher magnification SEM images of green produced G-Ag NPs and G-Ag NPs@rGO by aqueous leaf extract. The SEM images show that biomolecules in sida acuta leaf extract had a major role as a reduce, cap and stabilizing agent in the production of spherical Ag nanostructures. The physical aspects such as pH maintained, temperature of the solution and concentration of the leaf extract utilized all contribute to the NPs' spherical shape

(b). AgNPs form clusters on rGOnanosheets owing to the powerful electrostatic and electrical affinity between Ag and rGO. A multitude of leaf extracts have been employed for the fabrication of Ag NPs and rGO nanocomposites for anti-microbial and anti-cancer activities based on their morphology which are surveyed with many literatures as so far listed in the
