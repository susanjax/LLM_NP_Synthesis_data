Materials and characterization techniques
All chemical reagents were at least reagent grade. Silver nitrate (AgNO3, 99.99%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and methanol solution were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Company. All water used in the experiment was triply deionized water.
Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using SPE (SPE-AgNPs)
The SPE capped AgNPs (SPE-AgNPs) were synthesized using our previous protocol (
Shirzadi-Ahodashti et al., 2021a
). Typically, 0.3 g of S. pachycarpa extract was dissolved in 20 ml of distilled water, and the pH was raised to 12. The preparation of silver nanoparticles was observed by a color change from yellow to blood red according to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). After that, the silver solution was further centrifuged and washed three times at room temperature. Finally, the purified AgNPs were stored for further study. Furthermore, a description of the samples prepared under different conditions is exhibited in

FESEM, TEM, and EDX analysis
The size and morphology of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images with different magnifications.
Fig. 4
 shows the FESEM micrographs of as-synthesized silver nanoparticles in the presence of S. pachycarpa extract with different magnifications (SPE-AgNPs). The results showed that the produced nanoparticles are spherical-like, and agglomerated in some areas. This agglomeration confirms the presence of stabilizing and capping agents in the process of formation AgNPs. Furthermore, regular and uniform structures with sizes in the range of 30â€“40 nm are another characteristic of synthesized nanoparticles.
Fig. 5
 shows TEM images of the synthesized silver nanoparticles in the presence of S. pachycarpa extract (optimized sample; SPE-AgNPs). Uniform nanoparticles and suitable distribution extract on the surface of silver nanoparticles are illustrated in
Fig. 5
. Moreover, the TEM images verify the synthesis of spherical and oval-like nanoparticles with even distribution and an average size of approximately 36 nm.
Fig. 6
 illustrates the EDS microanalysis of the obtained SPE-AgNPs. A strong Ag absorption peak appeared at 3 KeV. The Ag, O, and C elements in the chemical composition of SPE-AgNPs were detected. These results are directly related to XRD results.
