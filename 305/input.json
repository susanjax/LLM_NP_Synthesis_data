Preparation of Se NPs
0.4 g of sodium selenite was stirred with 50 ml DDD. 0.4 g of albumin was stirred in 40 ml DDD. The solutions were then mixed at 303 k for 2 h, and a colour varied to reddish, this change indicates the production of Se NPs, using a magnetic stirrer and left for ∼5 h to complete the reduction. After 14 h of incubation, the preparation was centrifuged at 10 krpm for 1 h.
PVA/CMC/Se NPs nanocomposite sample preparation
PVA/CMC/Se NPs samples were prepared via casting method. PVA and CMC were dissolved separately in DDD, then, the polymers were added together for 6 h to obtain PVA/CMC (70/30 wt%) blend, then various concentrations (0.0, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8) wt.% of Se NPs were added to the blend solutions. At last, the nanocomposite solutions were cast into Plastic dishes and leave to dry at 40 ∘C for 72 h. The thickness of the obtained films was in the range between 47 and 88 μm. The prepared nanocomposite samples were kept in vacuum desiccators until employ.
The XRD scan for synthesized Se NPs was exhibited in
Fig. 1
. The scan of pure Se NPs shown the general properties of Se NPs have been previously founded by other authors [

] and compared with JCPDS file no. 06–362. All peaks are assigned and indexed for cubic phase and with approval with the studied lattice parameters a = 4.3 and c = 4.9 Å. The crystallite sizes of 2θ and the FWHM of the peaks (h k l) were evaluated using Scherrer relation [

TEM micrograph of Se NPs
TEM has been used to determine the size and distribution of Se NPs.
