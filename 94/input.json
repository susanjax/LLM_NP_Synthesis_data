Synthesis of gold nanospheres using extract
The nanosphere synthesis process is illustrated in Fig. 1a. The stock solution described in the previous section was used for synthesis. In a glass vial, the extract (final concentration of 0.03 %) and chloroauric acid trihydrate (final concentration of 0.5 mM) were mixed, and sodium hydroxide (final concentration of 1 mM) was added. Deionized water was added to make a final volume of 2 mL. Oven incubation was performed in a dry oven at 80 °C for 2 h. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the nanospheres was monitored by acquiring UV-visible spectra over the range of 300~800 nm. The nanospheres were also used as seeds for the synthesis of nanostars described in the following section.
Synthesis of gold nanostars
The nanostar synthesis process is illustrated in Fig. 2a. The nanospheres (50 μL) synthesized as described in the previous section were stirred (750 rpm) with a magnetic bar on a hot plate at ambient temperature. Chloroauric acid trihydrate (0.25 mM, 5 mL) was added to this solution. After 15 s, two solutions were added simultaneously: silver nitrate (1 mM, 50 μL) and ascorbic acid (freshly prepared, 100 mM, 25 μL). Then, the mixture was stirred at 750 rpm for 5 min. UV-visible spectra were acquired over the range of 300~1100 nm.
Chitosan capping of nanospheres, nanostars, and nanorods
Chitosan capping was employed to increase the colloidal stability and biocompatibility of AuNPs. Chitosan was dissolved in 1 % acetic acid, and the final concentration was adjusted to 0.01 %. Then, sonication was performed to completely dissolve chitosan; this solution was used as a stock solution for chitosan capping in the following procedure. Both nanospheres and nanostars that were previously synthesized were capped with the chitosan stock solution (0.01 %). The chitosan stock solution (30 %, v/v) was mixed with the AuNP solution (70 %, v/v). The mixture was stirred at 900 rpm for 2 h to complete chitosan capping. For nanorods, excess CTAB was used, and thus, centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 15 min, 25 °C) was performed to remove CTAB. The nanorods were recovered from the pellet, and the chitosan capping was conducted as mentioned above. Then, UV-visible spectra were acquired.
Characterization of gold nanoparticles
Next, the hydrodynamic size and zeta potentials were measured; the results are shown in Table 1. Without chitosan capping, the hydrodynamic sizes of nanospheres and nanostars were 28.4 and 97.8 nm, respectively. The hydrodynamic size of the nanorods was not measured because the hydrodynamic size was well adjusted to the spherical shapes of the nanoparticles. With chitosan capping, the hydrodynamic size was increased to 190.7 nm for nanospheres and to 123.9 nm for nanostars. Chitosan capping was confirmed by an increase in hydrodynamic size. The change in zeta potentials also reflected chitosan capping on the surface of AuNPs. Chitosan is a positively charged polysaccharide; thus, chitosan capping resulted in positive zeta potentials for all three types of AuNPs. For the nanospheres, the zeta potential was altered from − 12.73 to 42.28 mV. The zeta potential of the nanostars was altered from − 42.46 to 47.44 nm. In the case of the nanorods, CTAB (a cationic surfactant) was utilized for synthesis. Thus, the original zeta potential was 27.96 mV without capping. The chitosan capping of nanorods increased the zeta potential to 33.23 nm. Therefore, the change in zeta potentials from negative to positive values for the nanospheres and nanostars clearly indicated successful capping with chitosan. Furthermore, the zeta potential of the nanorods increased, suggesting that the surface was capped with chitosan.
