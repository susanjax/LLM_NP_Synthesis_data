Green synthesis of AgNP from Azadirachta indica
Fresh leaves of Azadirachta indica were collected from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research institute (ICAR, Old Goa) campus. The leaves were thoroughly washed in DI water and dried in a hot air oven at 60 °C until crisp.1 g of dried crisp neem was ground using a mortar and a pestle using sterilized DI water. The extract was then filtered with Whatman filter paper number 1 (11 μm pore size) medium flow filter paper to remove plant cellular debris from the solution). 0.1% of 1 mM AgNO3 was added to the filtered neem extract in equal ratios and kept in dark at room temperature for the synthesis of AgNPs. After about 12 h of incubation, the color solution changed from light green to reddish brown indicating the formation of AgNPs. Neem broth containing AgNPs was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min, and the precipitate was properly cleaned with sterile distilled water to remove any unwelcome contaminants. The solution was stored at 4 °C for further characterization and testing.

The formation of AgNPs was examined and confirmed by obtaining the respective absorption spectra, Fourier transform infrared spectra, dynamic light scattering profile, and scanning electron microscopy images. Preliminary characterization of the reduction of silver ions to AgNPs was carried out by measuring the UV–Visible spectra of AgNP solutions from 300 to 800 nm. Due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of AgNP, which depends on the form, size, and size distribution of the nanoparticles, noble metals, notably gold (Au) and silver AgNPs display distinctive and controllable optical features [4,6,22,29,30]. A prominent broad peak in the UV–visible spectrum was seen at 445 nm, and the peak's broadening suggested that the particles were polydispersed (Fig. 3(a)). Next, ATR-FTIR was carried out in order to identify the presence of various functional groups in biomolecules responsible for the bioreduction of Ag+ and capping/stabilization of AgNPs. As seen in Fig. 3(b), the peak around 3320 cm−1 is due to the presence of bonds due to Osingle bondH stretching, 2337 cm−1 is due to aldehydic Csingle bondH stretching, and 1618 cm−1 peak is due to Cdouble bondC group. These bands correlate to the presence of terpenoid compounds present from neem solution which are required for the formation of nanoparticles [[22], [23], [24]]. The major bio-molecules responsible for the green synthesis of AgNPs present in the aqueous extract of neem extract were identified by ATR-FTIR spectrum. AgNPs were subjected to measurement of polydispersity and quantitative size distribution using the DLS method. DLS monitors dynamic changes in light scattering intensity brought on by the Brownian motion of the particles to determine the size distribution of the particles [25]. A temperature equilibration time of 1 min at 25 °C was used for all measurements, which were performed in triplicate. As shown in Fig. 3(f), nanoparticles revealed an average size of diameter 84.17 nm with a polydispersity of 0.232. The topographic features of the green synthesized AgNPs were analyzed using SEM. The AgNPs are mostly spherical-shaped nanoparticles with a diameter 80–90 nm (Fig. 2(c), 2(d), 2(e)) [26].
