Methods of synthesis
ZnO NPs were prepared using the combustion method associated with honey and cow urine. Honey and cow urine have been used here as a fuel to prepare nanostructures in the process of combustion. To prepare ZnO NPs, analytical grade Zn(NO3)2·6H2O(Merck 99%) and honey/cow urine are used as raw materials. To preserve the stoichiometry of ZnO NPs, 0.5 mol of zinc nitrate is dissolved in 50 ml of distilled water. Precursor solutions are blended with 50 ml of pure honey (natural fuel) that acts as a chelating agent. This mixture of the solution was mixed thoroughly for 1 h. Using a magnetic stirrer, the mixed solution was further stirred under heating at 100 °C until the desired final powder was obtained. An agate mortar was used to crushes the product in into a fine powder. Instead of honey, the same process was performed with 50 ml of cow urine to prepare ZnO NPs. The synthesised samples are labeled as (Z1) in case of cow urine assisted and (Z2) in the case of honey assisted combustion method. The graphical representation of synthesis process is shown in

Characterization
The XRD pattern of ZnO NPs prepared by using cow urine (Z1) and honey (Z2) are depicted

. The noted diffraction planes (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112) and (201) are well coordinated with JCPDF Card No.: 036–1451 showed the pure phase of ZnO NPs without secondary phases. The sharp peaks revealed the crystalline nature of ZnO NPs. This specifies the reliability of honey and cow urine to choose as capping and reducing agents in green synthesis approach. The indexed diffraction planes indicate the phase of ZnO NPs belongs to hexagonal Wurtzite structure of p63mc space group [

Table 1. Crystal parameters of ZnO NPs using cow urine and honey.

Sample	Crystallite size from XRD (nm)	Lattice constant	Morphology	Zeta Potential (mV)
‘a’(Å)	‘c’(Å)	c/a
Z1	29	3.2592	5.2133	1.5995	Hexagonal and Leaf like structures	−18.3 (Negative charge)
Z2	23	3.2510	5.2097	1.6024	Spherical	−20.8 (Negative charge)
It was observed that there is marginal difference in the lattice parameter of the two samples. It can also observed that the lattice parameter of ZnO NPs prepared using honey is slightly less than the lattice parameter of ZnO NPs prepared using cow urine. It is ascribed to the changes in Zn–O bond lengths. The experimental values of lattice parameter are consistent with the literature reports [

]. The FWHM of diffraction peaks are used to calculate crystallite sizes. The mean crystallite size was approximately found to be 23 nm for the honey-assisted sample and 29 nm for the assisted cow urine sample.
