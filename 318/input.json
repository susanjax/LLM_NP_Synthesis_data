Green synthesis of AgNPs
Freshly one mili molar (1 mM) silver nitrate (AgNO3) was primed with double sterilized water in 250 mL of Erlenmeyer flask. About 10 mL of aqueous fruit extract was mixed to AgNO3 (90 mL) and suspensions were constantly stirred with glass rod. After 15 min, the colloidal suspension was changed its color from light yellow to dark brown, suggesting that the formation of AgNPs. Which again attributes to the plasmonic resonance of the surface electrons of the nanoparticles on the surface [[33], [34], [35], [36]].
The X-ray diffraction analysis was used to analyze crystalline nature of the AgNPs synthesized by the fruit extract of L. acidissima. The 2θ values of diffraction peaks are 37.74°, 44.90°, 64.32°, and 77.31° which corresponds to the planes at (111), (200), (220) and (311) respectively (Fig. 3). The resultant data was matched with JCPDS file no. 04–0783. The value (111) shows full width half maximum (FWHM) which is used to estimate the utmost size of the AgNPs by the formula Debye-Scherrer's equation and it was found to be 29.05 nm. This result was very similar to the synthesis of AgNPs by leaf extract of Averrhoa bilimbi and Nerium indicum [45,46].
The surface chemistry (mainly size and shape) of the AgNPs was estimated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. The topographical 2D and 3D views have shown surface morphology, distribution of the AgNPs (Fig. 5A). However, the surface particle size of the AgNPs affirmed to be 78.4 nm with irregular and spherical shaped (Fig. 4A and B). Fig. 4C represents the distribution of AgNPs.
