Biological synthesis of AgNPs
The biological synthesis of AgNPs was carried out in the presence of 10 mL yeast extract in an Erlenmeyer flask. The flask was kept on an orbital shaker under constant shaking at 600 RPM at 60 °C. Then, 90 ml dropwise, 1 mM (1 mM) of an aqueous silver nitrate solution was added. On the orbital shaker, the reaction was kept at 60 °C for 48 h in the dark with constant shaking. Gradually, the color of the reaction changed from colorless to dark yellow. After 48 h, this reaction mixture was centrifuged and washed several times with water while the centrifugation helped remove the untreated salts and extract to perform the dry pellet. This pellet was kept at 40 °C to acquire the NPs powdered form.

FTIR analysis is an essential process to analyze the involvement of functional groups in synthesizing NPs. The FTIR spectra recorded the difference in wavelengths or change in intensity shift, which gives an idea regarding which functional groups are present in the binding mechanisms of NPs synthesis. In this study, we recorded the FTIR spectra for the yeast extract and the AgNPs. A comparative analysis of the FTIR spectra indicated in (Fig. 4F) a simplified spectrum, suggesting a selective capping of P. pastoris extract components covering the metal NPs. FTIR analysis also provides insight into the encapsulation and stability of NPs because the reduction of metal ions is due to secondary metabolites in the biological extract. In this study, we observed different peaks at a wavelength of 3277 cm−1, 1631 cm−1, 1537 cm−1, 1398 cm−1, 1238 cm−1, and 1047 cm−1 in extract, and in AgNPs shows 3284 cm−1, 1641 cm−1,1573 cm−1, 1388 cm−1, 1288 cm−1, and 1068 cm−1. The functional group followed at 3277 cm−1 -3284 cm−1 can belong to the N–H stretching of a secondary amine and weak broad OH stretching alcohol (H2O) [27]. The 1631 cm−1-1641 cm−1 and 1398 cm−1-1573 cm−1 peaks indicate the CO stretching vibration and N–H stretching bending in their amide linkages. In addition, the 1641 and 1631 cm−1 peaks may as well be from the CC bond of aromatic compounds. Also, the 1398 cm−1-1388 cm−1 peak can be representative of the C–H bending vibrations of carbohydrates. Peaks at 1288 cm−1 and 1238 cm−1 and 1068 cm−1 and 1047 cm-1 are contributed from C–O and C–O–C stretching, respectively [28,29]. Fig. 4 TEM observed the shape and size of the synthesized NPs. The resulting AgNPs possess a spherical shape, with the average size of NPs in the 10–30 nm range. Fig. 4. The elemental constituent and relative abundance of the biosynthesized AgNPs were obtained from EDX, as presented in (Fig. 4. E). The EDX spectrum (Fig. 4. E) reveals the purity and the complete chemical composition of AgNPs. The reduced AgNPs were subjected to EDX analysis with an optical composition of elements showing atomic percentage, such as oxygen(O)57.2 %, carbon(C) 29.7 %, and silver (Ag)13.2 %. The other elements served as capping organic agents bound to the surface of AgNPs. While the TEM analysis gives insight into the average size distribution of synthesized NPs, the average size of particles was observed to be around 10–30 nm (Fig. 4A–E). The data obtained from EDX weight percent was used to calculate the yield of NPs formation with the help of online software [24]. In this study, we observed around 91.66 % of NPs formation from 1 mM Ag salt solution.
