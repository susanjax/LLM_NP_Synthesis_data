Synthesis and characterization
The polymer was synthesized using a chain-growth polymerization reaction using DABCO as a diamine and bis(bromoacetyl) cystamine (BBAC) as a cross-linker. Briefly, DABCO (1 mmol) and BBAC (1 mmol) were dissolved in methanol (10 mL) and stirred at 60 °C for 1 h. After that, methanol was removed from the reaction mixture, and the residue was pulverized in ethyl acetate 3 times to afford a white solid. Eventually, the precipitate was filtered and dried under vacuum.
As shown in 
Fig. 2
, the peaks at 1680, 573, 683, and 3430 cm−1 are assigned to stretching of the Cdouble bondO, Ssingle bondS, –Csingle bondS– and Nsingle bondH bonds, respectively. Size and polymer morphology were determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) (

). The average diameter of the nanoparticles was about 150 nm. According to gel permeation chromatography (GPC), the average molar mass by number (Mn) and weight (Mw) of the cationic polymer were 12,364 and 15,154 gr mol−1 respectively.
