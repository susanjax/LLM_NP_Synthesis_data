Green synthesis of cerium oxide nanoparticle (CeO2NPs)
A total of 3.72 g of cerium nitrate hexahydrate was added in 50 mL of M. oleifera leaf extract. The solution was stirred using a magnetic stirrer at 80 °C for 2 h, until the solution had changed color from dark brown to light brown. Resulting solid was calcined at 600 °C for 2 h, to obtain CeO2NPs.
Figure 1
. Depicts a schematic diagram of the synthesis process of cerium oxide nanoparticles.

The XRD pattern of M. oleifera-mediated synthesized-CeO2NPs is shown in
Fig. 2
. It shows the appearance of specific peaks in 2θ of 28.55°, 33.08°, 47.47°, 56.33°, 59.08°, 69.40°, 76.69°, and 79.07°, without any impurities. This pattern refers to cubic CeO2NPs with hkl of (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331) and (420), respectively, based on ICSD standard No 34–0394, confirming the successful formation of cerium oxide nanoparticles. Unlikely, the sample synthesized without extract exhibit some other peaks, which responsible to presence of impurities. In addition, it was found that the diffraction pattern of sample synthesized using extract provides higher intensity peaks than that diffraction pattern of another sample. This results strongly confirm the role of the extract in increasing the purity and crystallinity of as-synthesized cerium oxide sample.

The crystallite size of the samples was calculated using Debye Scherrer's equation, as shown below:
(1)
where which the crystallite size is D, the numerical factor referring to the crystallite shape factor is K, the wavelength of X-ray is λ, the value of full width at half maximum (FWHM) is β, and the diffraction angle is θ [
37
]. The average crystallite size of CeO2NPs synthesized using M. oleifera leaf extract was found to be 11 nm, while the crystallite size of CeO2NPs synthesized without the extract was 28 nm.

        Analysis of SEM was conducted to characterize the morphology of the nanoparticle surface. As shown in
Fig. 5
, as-prepared CeO2NPs are spherical in shape with a uniform size but undergo agglomeration. Kannan et al. [
18
] reported the synthesis of CeO2NPs using leaf extract of Acalypha indica, in which agglomeration of the nanoparticles occurred as well. When the SEM image was enlarged, it was clearly pronounced. The SEM 2D elemental mapping of as-synthesized CeO2NPs is shown in
Fig. 5
b. It is clearly shown that atomic Ce and O are contained in the sample, without any other atom. In addition, EDX analysis results showed high intensity peaks of Ce and O in a specific energy of 20 keV. The absence of impurity in the EDX spectrum indicate the success of the CeO2NPs synthesis process.


Figure 6
 shows the TEM micrograph of the as-synthesized sample. It can be seen that the nanoparticles were formed in a spherical form. The size distribution of the sample was determined using Image J software, and the result is shown in
Fig. 6
b. The size range is 5–40 nm, having a particle size average of 17 nm. The highest distribution is in range of 10–20 nm. This particle size is quite small compared to the particle size of CeO2NPs previously synthesized using other plants, e.g., leaves of Colotroposir procera [
24
], Prosopis juliflora [
23
], S. acuta [
22
], and Olea europaea [
21
], with an obtained particle size of 36 nm, 37 nm, 25 nm, and 25 nm, respectively. The use of plant extracts as a capping agent helps the synthesis of CeO2NPs, without the addition of acids or bases.
